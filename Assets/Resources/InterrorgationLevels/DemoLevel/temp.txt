{0.00->3.85}Defeat is but the catalyst of its own rectification.
{0.02->1.15}Where are the evac ships?
{0.00->3.72}Makin' sure these Hellpods don't malfunction is my number 1 priority.
{0.00->1.29}The Shete system
{0.00->6.47}No one likes a complainer. If your living conditions aren't to your liking, just remember, aliens {6.47->8.59}could kill us all at any moment.
{0.01->1.37}Steady now! Be ready!
{0.03->2.08}Mission at 20 minutes remaining.
{0.11->0.28}Well{0.80->2.07}these folks look safe!
{0.00->0.50}Charlie
{0.18->0.94}Out of stims.
{0.00->2.76}Sweet Liberty! They got a Helldiver!
{0.00->0.90}Marking location.
{0.00->0.86}New canister.
{0.01->2.89}How about a nice cup of Liber-tea!
{0.00->0.76}Joining the fray.
{0.00->1.05}Additional objective.
{0.01->1.75}For the glory of Super Earth.
{0.00->1.83}Thank Freedom they're on our side!
{0.02->1.16}There! Hide there!
{0.01->1.33}Automatons!
{0.05->1.93}It's gonna cut me open!
{0.02->0.99}What are those things?
{0.02->2.56}WHOA—that was loud!
{0.00->3.33}Recruit expired. Initiate terminid containment protocol.
{0.00->0.94}I've got you.
{0.01->3.14}Finish this fight, as they would have.
{0.03->1.31}Dropping item!
{0.02->0.93}More squids!
{0.00->0.38}1!
{0.00->1.32}The Pandion system
{0.00->1.07}This is the right place.{1.54->1.80}Right?
{0.00->2.76}All the galaxy looks to you for salvation. {3.12->6.07}Let nothing stand in the way of Liberty.
{0.00->1.75}No diver left behind.
{0.00->1.32}Reloading! Running low here!
{0.07->1.48}The Inari system
{0.00->1.89}They gave their all, for Liberty!{2.31->4.13}We will do the same!
{0.04->1.95}Super Uranium acquired.
{0.00->0.73}I win.
{0.51->1.36}Op - wrong way!
{0.02->6.07}You want my Freedom? MY Freedom?! Gotta try harder than that!
{0.04->0.68}Moving!
{0.00->0.95}Just what I was hoping.
{0.00->3.47}This world needs your righteous extermination, Helldiver.
{0.00->5.57}Helldiver. You face a Hive Lord. Liberty guide you.
{0.00->0.48}Five.
{0.00->2.90}If we stay close to the Helldivers, we're safe.
{0.02->0.92}Help me!
{0.00->1.80}The Elysian Meadows system
{0.06->1.89}It's just like on TV!!!
{0.03->2.53}It's nice, cuz today I won't have to work overtime to get 'em done.
{0.00->0.50}Okay.
{0.05->1.89}Take a moment to remember: {3.04->5.69}Every Helldiver is your friend. {7.02->8.69}Every single one.
{0.01->1.95}Reloading! Watch my six.
{0.00->1.34}Deploying Support Station.
{0.00->1.38}Calling in an orbital strike.
{0.04->5.09}When it comes to these Automatons, there's no fixing 'em. Only solution is to wipe the slate clean.
{0.00->1.69}No diver left behind.
{0.00->2.69}That's the flag of Super Earth, recruit! {3.08->4.89}Plant it in the designated area.
{0.00->0.69}That's not good.
{0.00->1.68}Change of plan - this way!
{0.00->1.16}Inputting drop point.
{0.09->0.95}Out of stims.
{0.30->1.95}Where are those reinforcements?
{0.06->2.92}RIP THEM TO PIECES, HELLDIVERS!
{0.00->1.69}Harmless animal.
{0.00->1.47}The Mortax system
{0.00->4.50}Never forget: we are all one Super Earth.
{0.00->3.54}The enemy has launched a cowardly attack against one of our planets. {4.23->5.13}Will you defend it?
{0.00->1.58}High-value sample collected.
{0.00->1.89}The Helldivers came for us!
{0.10->1.85}Squid Outpost destroyed.
{0.00->1.33}Point me to the enemy.
{0.00->3.52}One small scrap of technology, one giant leap for Liberty.
{0.00->0.75}Calling down fortifications.
{0.00->0.50}I'll take it.
{0.03->2.28}You can walk it off! Walk it off!
{0.00->2.20}Hellbomb armed—clear the area.
{0.00->0.95}Fortifications.
{0.00->0.54}Code is:
{0.04->1.48}It's the Automatons!
{0.00->1.68}Freedom's purity secured.
{0.00->2.55}Liberty calls for aid across the galaxy; {3.12->5.41}only you can decide where to answer.
{0.01->0.83}What is that?
{0.00->1.33}Calling down a vehicle.
{0.00->3.82}we just draw an imaginary line from the ship to the center of Super Earth, and then take our {3.82->7.98}distance from Super Earth, along with the latitude and longitude of where that line hits Super {7.98->8.65}Earth's surface. 
{0.00->1.26}Op - wrong way!
{0.00->3.03}YES, HELLDIVERS! YESSSSS!!!!
{0.00->2.31}Bug outpost spotted. Prepare to exterminate.
{0.01->4.53}Uh, Democracy for everybody!
{0.03->1.37}The Atrama system
{0.02->1.99}Manning combat walker.
{0.00->0.75}This is where the shuttle lands?
{0.00->0.95}Keep moving.
{6.10->9.47}Good evening, I'm your host, Coretta Kelly.{9.47->15.84}Further evidence reveals how the Illuminate used the Meridian singularity to enable their return.{15.84->27.66}The destruction of the Terminid Supercolony earlier this year appears to have created a wormhole, which the Illuminate were able to use to force entry into our galaxy.{27.66->40.45}Experts speculate that following the end of the first Galactic War, Illuminate refugees fled outside the Milky Way, trapping themselves in intergalactic space - until now.{40.45->44.69}An investigation is underway to determine if the scientists responsible for{44.69->49.51}the development of the Dark Fluid bombs used to destroy the Supercolony were{49.51->53.98}secretly under Illuminate mind control the entire time.{53.98->61.64}Coming up next: a teenager's homemade surveillance post finds dissident activity right in their own neighborhood.{61.64->65.77}Stay tuned.
{0.03->1.17}Help me, please!
{0.02->0.95}Take cover!
{0.03->3.81}Smells like Freedom to me.
{0.13->1.78}Special delivery!
{0.01->0.47}I'm out.
{0.00->1.39}Suppressing fire!
{0.01->2.21}Incoming. Choose your targets!
{0.03->2.88}That's right. Get those xenophobes out of our galaxy.
{0.15->1.69}Visualize the Flag. {3.67->4.24}See it {5.08->6.64}wrapping around your legs, {8.10->8.93}your arms, {10.50->11.28}your body, {13.04->14.00}your face. {16.08->17.29}You are safe.
{0.04->2.42}Get back, you filthy squids!
{0.00->1.61}Freedom never sleeps!
{0.03->2.17}If this is a trap, it's our{2.17->4.26}Democratic duty to be the bait.
{0.00->1.66}Crystallized E-710 acquired.
{0.00->2.22}An opportunity for Liberation. {2.78->4.04}We must seize it.
{1.43->3.16}Did you see that? They touched my hand!
{0.00->0.88}Sub-objective.
{0.01->1.46}The bugs are coming!
{0.00->1.25}The Cursa system
{0.01->2.63}We will remember their sacrifice.
{0.02->1.07}Bugs! Aaaaaah!
{0.00->0.89}Ouch.
{0.02->1.63}Sub-objective in your vicinity.
{0.03->1.41}I'll never forget this.
{0.01->1.07}More Red-eyes!
{0.00->1.15}Sample collected.
{0.00->0.93}Defense complete.
{0.00->0.60}Second one.
{0.00->0.30}Here.
{0.06->4.38}I'd ask if you were going to take a break, but I already know the answer. {5.09->9.34}You and your fellow Helldivers inspire me every day.
{0.00->2.31}The operation proceeds smoothly.
{0.01->2.66}Maintain formation! Make Super Earth proud!
{0.00->2.73}Our enemies have cut off our route to this planet. {3.30->5.16}The war has eclipsed us.
{0.00->3.09}But security on these babies tracked their location in no time.
{0.00->1.19}Decreased visibility. {1.65->3.22}Should help obscure our movements.
{0.00->0.48}Intel.
{0.00->1.20}This is crazy!
{0.00->1.45}The Acamar system
{0.00->1.39}The Hesoe system
{0.00->1.82}Liberty save me!
{0.03->3.38}5 minutes left. We can't stay this low much longer, Helldiver.
{0.00->3.09}You cannot allow the bugs to infest this planet.
{0.00->4.31}Today's defeat stokes the forge of tomorrow's victory.
{0.11->0.78}Never doubt...{1.35->2.64}never doubt...
{0.00->2.49}Democracy fills my sample container.
{0.00->4.69}True citizens of Democracy can spot fascism with a single glance. {5.10->8.75}Consult your Loyalty Pamphlets to brush up on the telltale signs!
{0.00->1.67}They knew what they signed up for.
{0.00->1.26}Breathe easy, citizen.{1.67->3.61}We got Helldivers with us.
{0.00->1.39}The Gacrux system
{0.01->3.77}A Helldiver! A real Helldiver!
{0.01->1.91}Live to Liberate another day!
{0.03->1.96}It wants my brain!
{0.02->1.21}Artifact collected.
{0.05->2.40}We'd spend all day making Bots outta whatever we could find.
{0.00->3.10}Then when the Helldiver was done, *pop*, jettisoned into space.
{0.01->2.07}MAN I wish I could shoot like that!
{0.00->1.48}Biological sample secured.
{0.00->0.69}Engaging.
{0.00->1.43}The Partion system
{0.00->0.73}Stay low!
{0.00->0.43}Thank you.
{0.00->0.83}At once.
{0.04->1.51}More samples. Good. {1.98->5.04}I'm looking forward to seeing what Destroyer upgrades you can get for them.
{0.01->1.75}Let's take the fight to them!
{0.00->3.60}They gave their all, for Liberty! We will do the same!
{0.00->1.86}Support weapon inbound.
{0.03->2.14}That'll teach 'em to think for themselves.
{0.00->1.31}The Minchir system
{0.00->3.72}The bots terrorize this planet with their mechanized brutality. {4.24->6.50}Dive to the surface and end them.
{0.04->1.66}Shoot them! Shoot them!
{0.00->1.85}Freedom never falters!
{0.00->2.10}The Helldivers battle for Freedom. {2.58->4.90}Let us decide where to enter the fray.
{0.00->0.77}Hail Super Earth.
{0.00->0.88}Protect us!
{0.02->1.19}Throwing grenade!
{0.00->0.82}Manned emplacement.
{0.08->3.23}Super Earth doesn't know the meaning of half measures!
{0.00->0.70}Found something.
{0.28->1.94}Unleashing Democracy!
{0.26->1.96}NO ENEMY OF FREEDOM {1.96->3.75}WALKS AWAY FROM THIS!
{0.00->1.24}Let's do this!
{0.00->3.03}Unthinking scraps of metal thought they could beat Super Earth? Well, {3.70->4.38}think again.
{0.06->4.92}Another step towards Galactic liberation. You may extract when ready.
{0.01->2.11}Uh - For Super Earth!
{0.00->1.91}Bust them all into scraps!
{0.00->1.15}Visibility decreasing.
{0.00->1.95}Contact! CONTACT!!!
{0.00->0.62}I'll take it.
{0.00->1.15}Marking extraction point.
{0.00->2.26}We've let 'em subjugate this planet long enough.
{0.00->1.60}Requesting orbital strike!
{0.00->1.54}The Gar Haren system
{0.00->1.87}You inspire me, Helldiver!
{0.00->0.95}Changing course?{1.42->2.25}Something go wrong?
{0.01->2.18}This Tyranny will not stand!
{0.00->0.95}Asset secured.
{0.00->7.30}Children of Super Earth, keep an ear trained on your parents for signs of rebellion! Signs include {7.51->14.60}disparaging Super Earth, distrust in managed democracy, asking questions, and any sentence that {14.60->20.41}includes the phrase "alien rights". A report today is a life saved tomorrow!
{0.01->0.89}Battery's drained!
{0.00->5.49}This area is in dire need of liberation from the Terminid scourge.{5.49->7.03}Activate that terminal!
{0.00->0.78}Leave me...{1.34->2.81}save Super Earth...
{0.06->1.66}Well done, soldier. {2.02->7.42}It takes uncommon resolve to move past the death of your ally with so little pause.
{0.03->1.44}The Demiurg system
{0.07->1.45}Sweet Liberty.{2.32->4.06}Always a sight to behold.
{0.02->0.73}The enemy!
{0.00->1.94}Don't wanna end up talkin' to the Loyalty Officer.
{0.00->0.83}Loadout confirmed.
{0.01->2.23}Want me to go lure in some hostiles?
{0.00->0.83}Contact!
{0.01->1.47}Calling down objective equipment.
{0.02->0.72}Take cover!
{0.00->2.00}Change of plan - this way!
{0.00->2.06}Democracy will keep us safe.
{0.02->0.65}We're safe!
{0.01->2.60}GRENADE! Gather round, freaks!
{0.00->2.39}Guess those squids aren't so advanced after all.
{0.00->1.24}Disgusting squid.
{0.00->0.43}One.
{1.40->2.83}Eagle Sweat.{4.30->8.92}With an all-new formula containing 83% more sweat.{9.72->14.29}Eagle Sweat. Don't just smell it. Live it.
{0.01->1.45}Protect the children!
{0.00->1.73}Mission coordinates locked.
{0.00->1.73}It's how they would've wanted to go:{2.13->3.31}fighting Tyranny.
{0.01->1.49}Lightening Liberty's load!
{0.02->0.80}Hold Position!
{0.00->1.10}The Rogue system
{0.00->2.49}Repel these mucilaginous marauders.
{0.00->0.48}West.
{0.00->1.72}At least I saw{2.25->3.33}the Helldivers...
{0.03->1.37}It's the Illuminate!
{0.00->1.91}The existence of high-casualty missions {2.32->5.10}implies the existence of low-casualty missions. {5.87->7.90}And we can take some solace in that.
{0.04->2.44}I say again: reinforcement is available.
{0.00->0.65}Supplies.
{0.00->5.92}A Helldiver? Sir or uh, Ma'am, it is the GREATEST honor.
{0.02->1.77}It's the Helldivers!
{0.16->1.27}This evens the odds.
{0.00->0.69}Fourth one.
{0.07->0.88}ETA T-{1.42->1.82}1 minute.
{0.01->2.20}Nothing's gonna mess with this!
{0.00->0.37}Move.
{0.00->1.39}Calling down a support weapon.
{0.00->1.34}Launch initiated.
{0.03->1.68}Kill them! Kill them!
{0.00->1.67}High-value sample collected.
{0.00->1.79}Will the shuttle have enough room for all of us?
{0.00->0.47}Walker.
{0.02->1.17}Automatons!
{0.00->1.25}The Skitter system
{0.09->3.90}We gotta stop 'em before they get their tyranny all over the entire galaxy. Yuck.
{0.00->0.21}E-{0.57->3.22}710, the galaxy's greatest energy source.
{0.01->2.47}Trigger's set! Gangway!
{2.75->6.19}Barely even felt it...
{0.00->2.17}Crystallized E-710 acquired.
{0.00->1.78}Mission accomplished, Helldiver. {2.20->4.10}One small step for Democracy, {4.75->7.23}one giant leap in the death count of our enemies.
{0.14->1.46}I always knew you'd come.
{0.00->1.07}Requesting vehicle!
{0.02->1.20}Team reload required.
{0.00->1.36}The Bekvam system
{0.00->0.69}Follow me.
{0.02->1.16}Danger close!
{0.01->1.15}The tentacles!
{0.00->2.69}They're no match for the Helldivers!
{0.02->1.98}Go back to where you came from!
{0.01->2.39}Democracy will protect me...
{0.02->1.27}Thank Liberty!
{0.09->1.77}Now, enough jibjab! {2.24->6.78}The upcoming obstacles will take everything your exceptional physique can muster. {7.29->11.95}This is it. The real deal. Get to it, soldier!
{0.03->1.03}We can do this.
{0.00->1.80}Exactly what those squids deserved.
{0.00->2.35}Liberty is victorious once more.
{0.01->1.03}Bug outpost!
{0.00->0.94}Deploying flare.
{0.00->5.81}One small step for you, one giant leap for the FTL industry.
{0.02->1.50}An Eagle never misses.
{0.00->0.84}We're saved.
{0.00->0.84}Sample collected.
{0.05->0.36}Yeah, {0.91->2.77}I feel like everyone had a version of that story.
{0.00->1.11}It will be done.
{0.00->0.90}High-value item.
{0.00->1.24}The Slif system
{0.87->1.10}I need stims!
{0.02->1.88}Help! Help!
{0.00->1.25}Gotta swap batteries.
{0.00->1.50}The Emorath system
{0.01->2.09}Freedom never falters.
{0.00->0.53}Heavy.
{0.00->0.78}Southwest.
{0.01->1.58}Give 'em everything you got!
{0.00->1.48}Requesting supplies.
{0.00->0.89}Sample collected.
{0.01->3.63}Don't breathe!
{0.00->2.30}Funding approved for one more reinforcement.
{0.08->2.99}Sweet Liberty, my leg!
{0.00->1.37}The Sirius system
{0.02->0.53}Will do!
{0.01->2.07}Look...a Helldiver..!
{0.00->0.38}Mag.
{0.01->3.03}What in the name of Freedom...?!
{0.00->0.53}Intel.
{0.00->0.95}I got one!
{0.00->1.37}This thing sure is incredible.
{0.01->1.65}Freedom save me!
{0.00->1.66}The Grand Errant system
{0.00->6.68}Nine out of nine doctors endorse Super Earth combat stims. Plus, they're a great source of Vitamin {6.68->10.06}D! That's Vitamin D, for Democracy. {10.62->13.65}Paid for by Permacura. There is no evidence that combat stims provide Vitamin D. Please stim {13.65->14.18}responsibly.
{0.00->1.07}Dirty zealot!
{0.00->2.17}"Tell me, tell me!" shouted Danny.
{7.70->10.83}Freedom's Greetings, I'm Coretta Kelly.{11.45->15.70}Super Earth High Command declared the total victory of the Great Expedition,{15.99->23.12}following the successful reduction of the Gloom's spread and the discovery of Element 711 on its planets.{23.54->26.84}Now, the Helldivers have been deployed to support a new,{26.84->36.09}even more ambitious plan to extract E-711 and use it to secure plenty of living space for all Super Earth's citizens.{36.78->40.39}This plan has been named "Operation Free Space."{41.13->44.21}While the Gloom will be allowed to continue existing,{44.36->52.11}the Ministry of Defense has expressed high confidence in the Helldivers' ability to contain the amorphous space cloud.{52.82->53.90}In other news,{54.11->64.84}the heroic 10-year-old who turned in her own parents for dissident speech has become the youngest-ever recipient of the Super Presidential Medal of Ultra Freedom.{64.69->68.96}That's Liberty's Latest; I'm Coretta Kelly.
{0.01->4.16}Sweet, sweet Helldiver! You'll be okay! You'll be...
{0.01->1.12}Target reached.
{0.01->3.36}The only thing that burns brighter is Freedom itself.
{0.00->0.66}You win.
{0.00->3.04}Finish this fight, as they would have.
{0.02->1.69}Victory awaits us!
{0.09->3.89}This table standardizes planet sizes, but they're actually all pretty different.
{0.00->0.75}Get some! {1.22->2.15}GET SOOOOME!
{0.00->1.42}I need stims.
{0.00->0.34}One.
{0.01->5.21}To die for the cause... no greater...honor...
{0.04->1.80}What in Liberty's name!?
{0.00->0.49}Sample.
{0.00->1.52}Freedom always wins.
{0.04->3.95}He read all the official Super Earth histories, but it still wasn't enough for Danny.
{0.01->4.47}Kill them! Kill all of them! Teach those freaks the meaning of PAIN!
{0.00->1.31}Priority Alert.
{0.00->6.71}We've never been able to make Dark Fluid before; all we ever had was liberated from the Illuminate.{6.71->9.12}That's what makes E-711 so exciting.
{0.03->1.06}More squids!
{0.00->0.47}Illuminate.
{0.00->0.83}Helldiver. {1.21->3.93}The Super Destroyer is ready for your next mission.
{0.01->1.17}Gotta reload!
{0.00->3.35}Local fauna identified. Possible source for emergency rations.
{0.03->1.63}Bugs! Aaaaaah!
{0.01->1.86}Grenade - grenade out!
{0.01->0.79}Regroup!
{0.00->0.36}1!
{0.00->1.54}Ship's in top shape, Helldiver. {1.94->4.35}Ready to dispense Democracy wherever you choose.
{0.00->0.95}Requesting walker.
{0.00->1.39}Calling in mission shuttle.
{0.00->1.42}The Pherkad system
{0.00->3.76}We're probably just letting the hive grow so we can turn 'em into E-710.
{0.00->0.49}Charlie
{0.00->0.47}Sentry.
{0.03->0.78}That's too bad.
{0.00->1.35}We have to get out of here!

{0.00->1.60}I need a team reload!
{0.01->2.14}Plenty more where that came from!

{0.00->4.23}You might hear people ask, "do we really need all those planets?" {4.62->10.02}The truth is, if you hear this, report the traitor who said it to the nearest Loyalty Officer {10.24->11.11}immediately.

{0.00->2.68}Watching Helldivers in action is great for crew morale. {3.24->4.41}It's even better than a {4.87->6.25}dissident execution.

{0.79->1.55}Uh, excuse me. {2.68->3.46}Please move through the training course quickly as possible. Thank you. Have a good day.
{0.16->1.95}That was almost as exciting as Liberty Day.
{0.00->2.05}You being here means everything.
{0.00->0.65}War. {1.09->2.60}It brings us together. {3.02->9.79}It makes us stronger. And it leads to countless new technologies, some of them related to saving {9.79->10.34}lives. {10.90->13.41}This, is why we fight.
{0.00->1.08}I hope it hurt.

{0.00->0.58}Helldiver. {1.32->2.80}Dire news greets us. {3.33->7.32}The Automatons have proved a greater threat to Democracy than anticipated. {7.94->11.15}The Helldivers must now fight the Automatons and Terminids both. {11.95->12.48}This {12.97->14.31}is why you were trained.
{0.00->3.56}Show these alien invaders no mercy.
{0.02->1.66}Get some! GET SOOOOME!
{0.06->4.60}Mmm! Smells like squid guts in here. Must've been a good mission.

{0.00->1.08}Time to move!
{0.00->1.86}Sorry, I got distracted.{2.34->3.02}What's happening?
{0.00->4.55}This city is a center of commerce. It must be defended!
{0.00->3.55}Those wretched, spore belching "Hive worlds"...{4.09->7.54}As expected, monstrosities thrive there,{8.07->9.95}even subterraneously.

{0.00->3.11}We are close to securing another planet for Democracy. {3.61->6.70}You could be the final determinant of its salvation.

{0.03->1.61}It's fish fry night at the chow hall. {2.50->4.11}I don't know what planets they get these fish from, {4.11->6.71}and I don't care. It's all fried, and it's all good.
{0.00->1.00}I don't understand...{1.53->4.27}We must have been sabotaged by automaton sympathizers.

{0.03->1.51}It's the Automatons!
{0.00->4.09}This operation is complete. You have served Democracy well.
{0.00->6.02}The Illuminate, in their hubris, think us incapable of deciphering their wicked plots. {6.39->11.09}But make no mistake: we will arrest their dark machinations. {11.87->13.67}Whatever they may be.

{13.61->19.28}New updates on the backfiring of the TCS in the Meridia system. Here's the latest:
{19.28->32.30}A preliminary investigation by the Ministry of Science reveals that the Termicide initially worked, quote: ""as intended,"" eliminating 99.6% of the Terminid population on all Barrier Planets.{32.30->41.71}However, on Meridia, some of the remaining Terminids not only survived, but actually began reproducing up to 20 times faster than before.{41.71->46.62}Scientists are now calling the planet a Terminid, quote: ""Supercolony.""{46.63->59.24}The mutations caused by the Termicide appear to be random, but according to the report, it is only a matter of time before the same reaction appears on the rest of the Barrier Planets.{59.24->65.18}The Helldivers may be in a race against time to deactivate the TCS before this occurs.{65.18->71.86}In other news, the disgraced scientists who developed the Termicide have been taken into custody,{71.86->75.75}and are to be investigated for dissident infiltration.{75.75->78.69}That's Liberty's Latest; I'm Coretta Kelly."

{0.00->0.86}Thank Liberty,{1.23->2.87}we needed reinforcements!
{0.01->1.23}Watch the flanks!
{0.00->1.84}Illuminate artifact acquired.
{0.00->1.45}Strength in numbers!
{0.00->2.26}I'm just updating the firmware on this Hellbot.
{0.04->1.71}Slimy freaks!
{0.00->5.59}The collateral damage you did to the city was well worth its defense. Not to mention, unavoidable.
{0.00->6.83}Why would you grant rights to an Automaton? After all, you wouldn't grant rights to a dishwasher.
{0.00->1.01}Battery's drained!
{0.00->1.22}I'll never forget this.
{0.00->1.28}The bridge is fore of here. {1.64->4.21}Talk to the Democracy Officer when you're ready to join the fight.
{0.02->1.27}The Fury system
{0.00->1.25}Additional extraction point located.
{0.01->3.23}They'll think twice before infringing on our Freedom again.
{0.01->1.03}Got a bead on them!
{0.02->1.27}Incoming!
{0.01->2.25}No more controlling minds for YOU!
{0.01->1.60}We need reinforcements!
{0.02->3.03}Can't take MY Freedom! Get your own!
{0.01->2.24}There! They found us!
{0.00->2.13}Gonna turn their Homeworld into a junkyard.
{0.00->2.39}I haven't set foot on Super Earth myself, but {2.88->5.24}I've heard it's even more spectacular in person.
{0.00->1.03}The mission failed, {1.45->5.07}but your return means we recovered our most invaluable asset.
{0.00->1.55}A glorious performance.
{0.00->0.68}Code is:
{0.01->0.99}They killed them!
{0.00->2.73}I just filled out my Democratic Preferences Ballot for the election.
{0.00->1.71}Incoming fire detected.
{0.00->1.59}A little shot o' Liberty.
{0.03->1.00}The bugs are back!
{0.01->1.83}Liberty watch over us!
{0.00->1.49}The Iridica system
{0.01->0.75}We made it!
{0.03->1.56}What was that!?
{0.02->1.23}It's gonna eat me!
{0.00->2.00}Liberty has seen you through.
{0.00->1.52}A shrewd choice. {2.09->4.75}Each operation consists of several missions. {5.17->9.88}Decide where to begin...and we will prepare the Hellpod for your descent.
{0.00->1.36}We have to keep moving.
{0.00->0.38}Left.
{0.00->1.33}The Crimsica system
{0.00->1.53}We're all going to die!
{1.27->3.68}I forget the rest, but it's great to turn wrenches to.
{0.00->0.87}Enemies inbound.
{0.00->0.85}We've got equipment.
{0.00->1.30}The Penta system
{0.00->1.18}Helldiver reporting to the front.
{0.00->0.95}Calling down equipment.
{0.03->1.67}Get away from me!
{0.01->2.34}No more controlling minds for YOU!
{0.00->1.74}Calling in a Hellbomb.
{0.00->2.90}They say the squids come from somewhere outside the Galaxy. {3.46->4.86}If they know what's good for them, {5.34->6.61}they'll stay there.
{0.01->4.04}Our resolve in the face of Tyranny will be their undoing!
{0.00->2.94}Not a Helldiver! It should have been me!!!
{0.01->2.48}Tyranny will never prosper!
{0.03->0.92}There's more of them!
{0.00->3.85}One step closer to a galaxy purged of xenophobia.
{0.00->1.41}Bug outpost spotted.
{0.06->1.08}Eat Liberty!
{0.01->4.07}Maintain formation! Make Super Earth proud!
{0.00->0.36}You {0.89->2.53}are a paragon of Liberty.
{0.00->0.34}Three.
{0.06->1.93}Plenty more where that came from!
{0.00->1.79}Freedom is its own reward—{2.49->3.45}but this doesn't hurt.
{0.00->0.98}Whoa!{1.21->4.05}Not every day you get to see a Hellbomb.
{0.00->1.29}Black saffron. {1.68->3.74}Life saving and non-habit forming.
{0.00->1.25}History matters! {1.62->8.95}After the First Galactic War, Super Earth kindly allowed the Cyborg Secessionists to live, giving {8.95->12.35}them stable work deep within the mines of Cyberstan. {12.71->20.11}But, twisted by their implants, the Cyborgs sought their revenge by creating The Automaton Legion!
{0.00->1.90}Will the shuttle have enough room for all of us?
{0.00->4.04}Hey there, Helldiver. I know you put your neck on the line for regular folks like me every day.
{0.00->0.38}Nice.
{0.00->3.89}Push back the enemy. End their unjust occupation.
{0.00->5.37}He would have to strap an Illuminate anti-matter generator to his chest and Liberate all his old {5.37->5.86}friends. 
{0.00->0.99}Liberty. {1.43->4.15}Dissidents don't know the meaning of the word. {4.68->10.08}That's why Super Earth has introduced a zero strike law for patriotic intolerance.
{0.00->5.10}Helldiver. The industrial might of the Automatons has become a grave threat.
{0.00->0.70}High-value item.
{0.02->1.19}Swapping battery.
{0.01->1.46}Safe and sound.
{0.00->0.92}Package acquired.
{0.00->0.80}Enemy patrol.
{0.00->2.18}It'd be my Patriotic privilege.
{0.02->1.12}Calling down a vehicle.
{0.02->3.24}FOR SUPER EAAAAARRRTTHHHH!
{0.13->2.49}I've rarely seen Liberty dispensed so rapidly.
{0.01->1.85}Special delivery!
{0.00->1.34}Activating jump pack.
{0.00->2.25}Taking back what's ours, one by one!
{0.00->1.31}Mission progress logged.
{0.00->3.63}Worth...any cost...
{0.00->1.74}What did they ever do to you?!
{0.03->4.62}A while back, a bunch of dissidents hacked a ship's TVs, played a bunch of undemocratic trash.
{0.00->0.87}Fortifications.
{0.00->1.06}FIRE IN THE HOLE!
{0.00->0.70}Stimming you.
{0.00->1.42}This is where the shuttle lands?
{0.00->0.25}Black saffron harvested.
{0.00->0.68}First one.
{0.03->0.84}Changing I.C.E.
{0.03->1.85}Sweet Liberty, it's the Helldivers!
{0.09->2.43}A small price to pay for Freedom!
{0.00->1.50}I almost thought you wouldn't make it. {2.07->2.94}Glad I was wrong.
{1.48->2.48}Gets me every time.
{0.00->7.73}There is no greater honor than defending our way of life. Remember, winning is more important than {7.73->8.21}living!
{0.00->1.05}A true hero.
{0.02->2.29}Thank Freedom they're on our side!
{0.00->1.05}Requesting orbital.
{0.00->0.74}Dropships.
{0.01->5.04}YEEEAH! EAT LIBERTY! THERE'S ENOUGH FOR EVERYBODY!!
{0.00->1.63}Requesting supplies for the cause.
{0.01->1.23}RUN!
{0.00->0.63}ETA T-{1.05->1.95}10 seconds.
{0.00->3.04}When this city erects a monument to its saviors,{3.33->6.95}their sacrifice will be proportionately represented.
{0.00->1.24}For prosperity!
{0.00->0.69}I need ammo.
{0.02->1.97}The only good bug is a dead bug!
{0.05->1.25}What is that?
{0.00->0.91}Last one down.
{0.00->0.93}Orbital inbound!
{0.00->2.37}Disgusting fascists just won't stop.
{0.04->1.89}Slimy freaks!
{0.02->0.82}Illuminate!
{0.00->1.32}Calling down objective equipment.
{0.00->0.90}Hold firm!
{0.04->1.47}More Automatons!
{0.19->0.85}200 meters.
{0.00->0.95}Calling in extraction!
{0.00->1.15}Good work down there. {1.86->4.23}Could always use more samples, of course.
{0.00->1.30}Liberty dispensed.
{0.00->1.11}Requesting equipment!
{0.04->0.80}Watch out!
{0.05->1.29}Are we nearly there?
{0.00->1.13}Package retrieved.
{0.00->1.21}Eat this!!!
{0.00->1.47}Squid outpost spotted.
{0.00->0.95}Squid warp gate.
{0.00->2.03}Launch countdown complete. We have to leave now!
{0.40->4.74}I guess those squids got a breather for now. But they better watch their suckers, cuz we'll be back.
{0.09->5.73}Stretch your body. Stretch your mind.{5.73->13.61}Let it wander, let it wonder, about Liberty's grace.{13.61->24.16}This is where curiosity is safe; when dwelling on what we already know.
{0.04->4.03}YEAH! SHOOT THEIR HEADS OFF! LEAVE NOTHING BEHIND!
{0.00->0.79}Need to reload!
{0.00->1.70}A few more operations like that, {2.12->3.84}and the bugs are good as extinct.
{0.00->2.03}Always good to have another hero on board.
{0.03->1.12}Grenade!
{0.00->2.85}All set to Liberate a hole in their head...
{0.02->0.80}Throwing grenade!
{0.00->4.28}Ours are the hands that will tear asunder the binds of tyranny.
{0.00->1.54}The Chort Bay system
{0.01->1.85}Managed Democracy in action!
{0.00->1.57}The Claorell system
{0.02->0.90}They killed them!
{0.00->1.29}The Viridia system
{0.02->1.44}Reinforcing!
{0.00->4.65}Remember the 3 S's: Security, Solidarity, {5.01->6.10}Surveillance.
{0.00->1.43}Calling down supplies.
{0.00->2.19}We'll make those fascist insects pay.
{0.46->4.14}*scoffs* Great idea. Everyone'll just become a political expert overnight. {4.51->5.53}Treasonous morons.
{0.00->5.52}Show your loved ones that you have the courage to be free by rejecting your retirement and {5.52->6.34}reenlisting!
{0.00->0.51}I'm on it.
{0.10->4.06}You will be among the first to foray into the depths of the Gloom. {4.72->7.30}We know not what horrors lurk within. {7.98->10.75}Be ready for anything, Helldiver.
{0.00->0.46}No!
{0.00->1.31}Tech sample acquired.
{0.17->1.58}It's really them!
{0.06->1.08}They're coming!
{0.00->0.44}Danger.
{0.00->1.16}VIP secured.
{0.02->0.68}Sixth one.
{0.02->3.40}You are the tinder, and Liberty is the match!
{0.00->3.42}They're only programmed to kill. That's why they won't die.
{0.00->0.52}Vehicle.
{0.00->5.76}The Illuminate have returned, but their autocratic intentions remain shrouded in mystery.
{0.01->1.92}Get your own Democracy!
{0.00->3.40}You get the family separation bonus, which more than makes up for the bunk and chow fees.
{0.00->3.46}We must give no less than the entirety of our being {3.84->5.41}in service to Freedom.
{0.01->1.64}Democracy deliver us!
{0.00->1.10}Democracy delivered.
{0.00->1.19}That was not good.
{0.00->2.91}Their bodies dirty up our streets.
{0.02->1.18}Cover my sector!
{0.00->0.91}I need supplies!
{0.01->4.37}It was my... patriotic p-privilege...
{0.00->2.38}Those bots didn't stand a chance against you.
{0.02->0.77}It's them!
{0.00->2.78}Lots of enemies killed, lots of samples collected. {3.48->5.24}That's a good mission in my book.
{0.02->3.45}This is Coretta Kelly with All you Need to Know.{3.45->7.83}With the Helldivers making significant progress in their war on the Gloom,{7.98->10.67}citizen morale is at an all-time high.{11.08->15.78}Early childhood literacy rates are on the rise; experts say new{15.78->18.64}colorful leaflets are responsible for the difference.{18.79->25.89}And: scientists have successfully brought the African Elephant back from extinction - with some improvements.{26.16->32.44}With triple the tusks, these gentle giants may soon be ready to join the workforce.{32.98->35.31}And that, is All You Need to Know.
{0.05->1.17}Within the Gloom, {1.66->5.08}the Terminids have been enhanced into even deadlier predators. {5.48->9.37}But they remain mere quarry for Democracy's elite.
{0.07->2.13}Eagle 1, rearming. Be back shortly.
{0.00->2.94}A true servant of Freedom keeps no companion, {3.73->6.00}save Damsel Democracy herself.
{0.00->0.81}Support weapon.
{0.01->2.03}S'gonna blow! Move!
{0.00->1.29}Not safe here either!
{0.00->1.15}Illuminate teleporting in.
{0.00->0.98}Now THAT'S{0.98->1.97}Democracy!
{0.00->1.67}Get 'em... for...{2.23->3.06}me...
{0.01->1.50}Remember your duty!
{0.00->2.27}I just wiped the hard drive, reset the whole thing. {2.82->3.74}Now it's back to normal.
{0.00->2.32}They're here! Protect us!
{0.00->0.56}Affirmative.
{0.00->1.18}Calling down a sentry.
{0.00->1.66}Legendary iridescence.
{0.00->1.60}We've made it to the objective!
{0.00->2.23}High Prioriy Target neutralized.
{0.00->0.36}Here?
{0.00->4.65}Delivering Democracy... it's beautiful.
{0.01->0.91}Steady now!{0.97->1.74}Be ready!
{0.05->2.00}Welcome to the bridge, Helldiver.{2.47->3.27}Join us,{3.74->7.56}as we bear witness to the diminishment of the Gloom.{8.02->10.65}And the rise of Democracy.
{0.15->0.87}Envision the {0.87->1.74}future.{1.74->5.09} Your descendants, smiling.{5.09->10.06} Super Earth, bright-towered in the sun.{10.06->21.99} Your cape, mounted on a pole, waving in the gentle breeze -- in time with the Super Earth flag.
{0.03->1.95}It's like they want the war to last forever.
{0.00->0.87}We've got equipment.
{0.00->1.08}Swapping battery.
{0.00->2.33}Increased visibility. We can see them. {2.96->4.15}They can see us.
{0.00->1.75}Freedom requires firepower.
{0.17->1.08}I've got this one.
{0.22->1.41}Please help! Please!
{0.03->2.06}We're all gonna die!
{0.00->2.58}Self-defense is our Democratic right.
{0.11->1.69}The Aurora Bay system
{0.01->1.07}Dropping item!
{0.21->1.72}Filthy Terminid scum!
{0.01->0.59}Sentry.
{0.00->2.79}Welcome, Helldiver. Glad to have you with us.
{0.00->1.22}The Castor system
{0.00->1.29}The Veld system
{0.01->2.47}Democracy will keep us safe.

{0.00->1.45}Delivering payload.
{0.01->1.12}Eat this!!!
{0.29->0.95}We're safe now!
{0.00->0.76}Not engaging.
{0.01->1.25}We knew you'd come!
{0.00->0.47}Negative!
{0.00->4.16}Good work, Helldiver. Whatever the bots try to build, we'll blow it apart.
{0.48->3.22}I've been up late the past few days playing Bug Farm Simulator.
{0.01->2.72}You see that! Best of the best!
{0.00->0.83}Enemies inbound.
{0.00->2.18}Gotta keep it protected from Automaton hacking.
{0.00->1.11}Activating jump pack.
{0.00->0.70}Pack's out.
{0.02->2.63}Hellbomb request approved; deploying now.
{0.00->0.63}This is it. {1.06->4.07}This is the solemn duty for which you were born. {4.50->6.05}Defend Democracy - {6.50->7.82}at any cost.
{0.01->3.57}Hold your breath!
{1.17->3.20}Hard work can get you there! {3.52->6.50}That is the Super Earth promise. {7.16->8.44}Put in your sweat. {8.89->10.07}Put in your blood. {10.68->14.03}Enjoy your patriotic responsibility. {15.08->19.27}Prove your dedication to the betterment of our federation...{19.58->24.19}And before you know it, you too will achieve your dreams. {24.77->26.08}Super Earth. {26.35->27.15}Freedom. {28.00->29.03}Justice. {29.40->30.74}Democracy... {31.60->33.46}And dreams.
{0.00->4.09}My favorite part about Stratagem Hero is that there isn't any extraneous dialogue to distract you {4.09->4.84}from the gameplay.
{0.03->1.21}What in Liberty's name!?
{0.02->1.67}Give them what they deserve!
{0.00->2.21}There's no day-night cycle onboard these ships. {2.77->4.93}I like to imagine it's always morning, {5.46->8.47}with a whole day of defending Freedom left ahead of me.
{0.01->1.09}My ears are ringing!
{0.00->1.08}I love you...{1.79->3.26}Super Earth...
{0.00->2.67}No no no no! Not a Helldiver!
{0.87->2.78}Thankful you're on our side, Helldiver.
{0.00->4.93}Remember: a patriotic mind is a protected mind.
{0.02->1.29}Need to reload!
{0.00->0.32}YES!{1.05->1.43}I mean,{1.95->2.48}roger that.
{0.00->0.25}For prosperity!
{0.00->3.69}Allied Destroyer joining squadron. Deploying Helldiver to combat zone.
{0.02->2.04}How'd you like the taste of Freedom?
{0.00->1.46}Local fauna.
{0.00->0.51}I win.
{0.03->4.20}If you've got any Medals or Super Credits, you can spend them in the Acquisition Center. {4.72->6.64}That's where they sell the fancy stuff.
{0.00->1.86}Additional extraction point located.
{0.00->1.98}Gotta make sure our machines don't get too smart, right?
{0.14->0.78}200 meters.
{0.06->1.74}What are those things?
{0.00->0.74}50 meters.
{0.00->0.38}This is the{0.79->1.82}right place. Right?
{0.02->1.13}Canister's empty.
{0.05->0.56}2!
{0.02->1.47}A real Helldiver. {1.73->2.73}So gallant.{2.92->4.02}So noble.
{0.00->2.88}You can walk it off! Walk it off!
{0.28->1.54}I just love these announcements.
{0.03->0.93}It's them!
{0.01->2.26}A Helldiver!? ...RRRAAAAGHHHH!!!!!
{0.00->3.36}Cargo loading complete, Transport C-43 ready for launch.
{0.11->0.30}It's them!
{0.02->4.67}They'll never take my... moral fortitude...
{0.00->2.06}Their lives were in our hands.
{0.00->2.65}Another sample collected for Democracy.
{0.03->1.32}We're gonna die!
{0.00->1.37}Are you sure it's safe here?
{0.03->1.26}More bugs!
{0.03->1.41}The bugs are back!
{0.00->1.18}Consider it done.
{0.00->0.69}Well done. {1.14->3.94}The enemy barely noticed our presence before we pulled out.
{0.00->1.26}The Marre system
{0.00->0.51}Walker.
{0.00->4.44}We enter the heart of the Gloom. Bleed it dry.
{0.01->3.12}Don't stop! Rip 'em up! Yeah!
{0.05->1.63}Squid outpost spotted.
{0.00->1.41}Hero down!

{0.00->0.79}Pack's out.
{0.00->0.68}Mourn,{1.07->2.18}then maim.
{0.00->1.95}How dare THEY attack US!
{0.03->0.87}I'm hit! {1.26->2.44}Sweet liberty…the {2.94->3.70}blood.
{0.00->1.63}Someone said the game was malfunctioning. {2.34->3.81}User error, if you ask me.
{0.00->5.06}The time has come to tear down the Automatons' despotic infrastructure.
{0.00->2.21}Dirty bug got what it deserved.
{0.00->1.37}Calling in orbital strike.
{0.00->0.95}I got the terminal.
{0.00->1.25}The Peacock system
{0.00->1.44}Tech sample acquired.
{0.00->3.13}We'll be generating fewer condolence letters than usual today. {3.84->4.39}Well done.
{0.00->1.28}The Fenrir system
{0.00->4.53}We're fighting two fronts: the Terminids on one side, the Automatons on the other.
{0.00->1.93}Freedom owes you a debt.
{0.01->0.86}Where to now?
{0.00->2.30}It's like they wanna take over the entire galaxy.
{0.62->1.99}I can't wait to get home again. It's {2.50->3.90}the little things you miss, you know? 
{0.04->4.46}Flag-forsaken bots. They just won't accept Freedom, no matter how hard we give it to them.
{0.00->0.50}You will never destroy our way of life.
{0.02->1.32}The Erata system
{0.00->1.86}This is the right place. Right?
{0.00->2.11}You're my oil now, bug.
{0.04->0.88}Go now. {1.37->3.95}Save this planet from infestation.

{0.00->0.33}No.
{0.00->1.06}The Chara system
{0.01->3.74}Our Democracy may be tested, but it will never be tainted.
{0.01->2.36}Now! Attack now!
{0.03->1.43}The Krakabos system
{0.05->4.24}Man, I can't believe we're actually gonna become Helldivers.

{0.01->2.55}That all you got?!
{0.05->3.23}You really are the best of the best.
{0.00->0.69}Keep moving.
{0.00->0.79}Hold Position!
{0.00->2.08}Operation complete, Helldiver. {2.72->5.19}Liberty shines a little brighter today.
{0.01->0.75}Grenade!
{0.00->0.88}High-value item.
{0.00->2.52}The Terminids might be escaped farm animals, {3.86->4.11}but {4.96->5.92}they've been multiplying {6.62->8.45}faster than our regular units {9.23->9.77}can keep up {9.77->10.00}with. But now that the Helldivers are going in, we'll have them under control soon enough.
{0.03->0.62}Thank you.
{0.00->0.65}Rolling out.

{0.00->1.67}Support Station on its way.

{0.00->2.59}It's a good day when we lose so few Helldivers.

{0.02->0.92}Need to reload!
{0.22->0.65}Bug hole.
{0.00->1.79}I hope they died in pain.
{0.07->3.43}And now, another helpful tip from General Brasch.{5.99->10.24}If you choose to reload your weapon before the current mag is empty, {14.50->17.25}those bullets end up wasted on the ground, {17.67->21.32}instead of buried in the beating hearts of our enemies.{25.10->26.05}I say: {26.42->27.82}waste enemies, {28.00->29.77}not bullets.{30.28->34.27}BRASCH TACTICS! Use 'em, or die trying.
{0.01->2.00}Say hello to Democracy.
{0.00->2.20}Pretty sure it's not armed yet.
{3.71->6.22}Not now! Not yet! So many Votes left to cast!
{0.04->1.77}Somebody help!

{0.00->1.93}Mission at 10 minutes remaining.
{0.00->4.11}Democracy is kind of like these machines I work on. It needs regular maintenance to keep running {4.11->4.60}smoothly.
{0.01->4.95}Liberty emerges victorious yet again. Extract when ready.
{0.00->4.37}Our forces fight to free this planet from the clawed grasp of the Terminids. {5.10->8.72}A litany of elite operations await your initiation.
{0.02->0.71}Over there!
{0.01->2.52}Helldiver!? VENGEANCE!
{0.00->3.59}Another step closer to a successful operation.

{0.00->3.52}Countless opportunities for Justice to be dispensed.
{0.00->0.82}I'm on the terminal.
{0.26->3.26}Sometimes I forget that we're just one piece of the puzzle. {3.88->7.95}Case in point, once we push back the bugs, the SEAF will take over, {8.51->10.35}guarding the construction of the TCS. {11.13->12.52}Everyone has their part.

{0.13->2.59}Step up to the platform, recruit. {3.51->5.06}You've earned it.
{0.00->3.26}Decreased visibility—should help obscure our movements.
{0.00->0.95}I don't think I can do that.
{0.00->0.50}Of course.
{0.07->2.23}Hopefully this means we can end the war sooner.
{0.05->2.38}Nothing's gonna mess with this!

{0.00->4.36}You know, in all the Super Earth records, there isn't a single confirmed case of a Hellpod killing {4.36->4.91}a Helldiver.
{0.01->2.79}It's armed?! Go go go go!!
{0.01->3.90}So, uh, are we getting evacuated, or, uh...?

{0.01->1.52}That was awesome!
{1.92->5.25}The Automatons should have been content with what they had. {5.92->11.88}Instead, they tried to take for themselves what the citizens of Super Earth had proudly built. {13.24->17.53}Now, they're going to find out just how hard every man, woman,{17.55->20.90}and child over 7 will work to stop them. {22.16->23.39}Do your part: {23.89->25.22}get to work!

{0.02->4.42}If I had all the Super Credits in the galaxy, I'd try to find some way to convince our enemies to {4.42->5.20}embrace Freedom.

{0.13->4.12}We have long realized the twisted nature of the Illuminate Cult, {4.57->8.35}but to mutate loyal citizens into enemies of Freedom...{9.13->11.47}an atrocity beyond imagining.

{0.00->1.08}Changing course!
{0.06->4.24}The mystery of our vanishing colonists is at last solved. {4.63->6.58}They were abducted by the Illuminate, {6.96->12.53}and transfigured into the betentacled assailants with which we must now contend.
{0.00->1.51}Showing us how it's done!
{0.00->3.38}I remember when my parents sat me down for the Bugs and the Bots talk.
{0.00->1.43}Sometimes, when I can't sleep, I {1.82->3.48}imagine what it would be like to live there.

{0.03->0.96}Dropping item!
{0.00->0.95}Let's do this!
{0.05->3.90}The Illuminate cannot be allowed to corrupt our lands.
{0.00->2.53}There's a lot more wires back here than you'd expect.
{0.00->2.95}Welcome aboard, Helldiver. I look forward to serving with you.
{0.05->4.06}Freedom has prevailed. Now head to the extraction point.

{0.00->1.78}Democracy has landed.
{0.99->2.38}good riddance.
{0.00->0.94}We've got 'em cornered.
{0.02->2.99}*sigh* But that's just a pipe dream. We gotta kill 'em all.
{0.03->0.90}They're back!
{0.02->1.20}Thank Liberty!
{0.00->0.85}Sub-objective.
{0.00->1.10}Right on target!
{0.26->2.12}I hate those filthy xenophobes.
{0.00->1.96}This'll all blow over soon enough.
{0.00->6.15}Any number of un-Democratic abominations could be waiting for us in the Gloom. It's past time we{6.15->7.06}cleared it out.

{0.02->1.03}Bot outpost.
{0.01->1.26}Reinforcing!
{0.00->1.48}They'll regret this.

{0.00->1.52}The Overgoe system
{0.00->0.50}I'm on it.
{0.01->2.48}Agh! Uh -- FIRE IN THE HOLE!
{0.00->3.15}All it took was reportin' some unpatriotic talk I heard in the barracks.
{0.00->0.49}First one.
{0.01->0.88}Dropping package.
{0.01->0.85}This is it.

{0.00->0.93}To the skies.
{0.01->0.66}I've got you.
{0.01->0.73}I'm out!

{0.05->2.44}Thankful you're on our side, Helldiver.
{0.00->2.44}Congratulations on completing training, Helldiver. {2.92->6.70}You're in charge of this vessel now. The Democracy Officer awaits you on the bridge. {7.09->8.57}Welcome to the Galactic War.

{0.03->1.20}When's the shuttle coming?
{0.03->2.27}Freedom spreads yet further. {2.67->4.20}Extract when ready.
{0.03->1.18}What is that?

{0.00->1.74}Off the streets!
{0.00->0.75}Changing I.C.E.
{0.00->5.29}You are the stakes upon which Liberty's invaders will be skewered.
{0.00->1.18}Gotta swap batteries.

{0.00->1.90}You really are the best of the best.
{0.00->0.83}We're stuck!
{0.00->1.91}New battery, same way of life.
{0.00->1.22}I'll never forget this.
{0.00->2.18}That operation earned us some breathing room—{2.78->3.86}and a commendation.
{0.00->1.70}Should've stayed home, scum!

{0.00->1.47}Can't wait until they're all dead.
{0.00->5.33}They died free, defying Illuminate control with their last breaths.
{0.00->2.51}They abandoned our mission and our cause. {3.06->5.09}Execution was our only choice.
{0.01->0.69}This way!

{0.00->1.66}The Vernen Wells system
{0.00->4.48}Let us dispense with the lingering vestiges of the Automaton resistence.
{0.02->1.45}I'll remember this forever.

{0.00->1.64}Requesting sentry.
{0.00->0.46}Alpha
{0.05->1.49}Freedom be with you, Helldiver.
{0.00->1.18}Enemy outpost spotted. {1.62->2.34}Look alive.
{0.00->1.18}Objective secured.
{0.00->0.99}For Justice!
{0.00->0.98}Nothing in the chamber.
{0.00->2.80}Their bodies will burn with the city itself.
{0.10->0.83}I don't get it. {1.40->2.65}Don't they wanna be free?
{0.00->1.62}I am the one who walks.
{0.00->1.81}Our way of life must be protected.
{0.00->2.53}They did their part. Now it's our turn.
{0.43->2.18}I still have to pinch myself sometimes.
{0.33->2.72}That's what happens when the Helldivers arrive!
{0.01->1.37}Don't let them see you.
{0.00->2.50}So nice that Super Earth gives you things'll that'll help you stay alive down there.
{0.00->0.95}Requesting vehicle!
{0.00->1.13}Nothing in the chamber.
{0.00->0.57}Package.
{0.01->3.56}They might take our lives, but they'll never take our values.
{0.00->1.37}The Mantes system
{0.00->0.49}Six.
{0.02->1.63}Calling down objective equipment.
{0.01->1.79}Hostiles in my sights!
{0.00->1.39}Sending down Support Weapon
{0.00->0.86}Aerial enemy.
{0.00->2.81}AGH! EARS RINGING!
{0.00->4.30}This is the largest Helldiver mobilization we've seen since the First Galactic War. {4.73->6.79}Our enemies don't know what's coming.
{0.06->0.93}Absolutely!
{0.00->1.97}No-one'll set this to blow anytime soon...{2.35->2.82}right?
{0.00->1.06}Requesting sentry.
{0.00->0.55}Got one.
{0.01->1.49}Requesting orbital strike!
{0.00->2.82}No Helldivers KIA on that mission. {3.54->5.73}This is cause for celebration.
{0.00->3.95}Upon which anvil shall Freedom's hammer fall, Helldiver?
{0.01->1.03}Bug hive spotted.
{0.02->0.98}Eyes up!
{0.00->1.35}The Meridia system
{0.00->1.38}Reloading support weapon.
{0.01->1.16}Dirty tyrant!
{0.00->1.40}I commend you.
{0.04->2.04}Flag-forsaken robots!
{0.00->0.88}Tagging location.
{0.00->1.29}I need a team reload.
{0.00->0.95}Additional objective.
{0.04->0.83}Helldiver. {1.32->6.22}The Terminids have spawned some foul new miasma to stain our galaxy.
{0.00->0.89}Got one.
{0.02->0.79}Understood.
{0.00->1.65}The Darrowsport system
{0.00->1.88}Long ship deployments are great for savin' up.
{0.00->1.09}Hold firm!
{0.00->1.87}Return the squids to oblivion.
{0.95->1.94}The Automatons. {2.53->4.38}Heartless killing machines. {5.21->9.04}It is an undeniable fact that they do not have hearts. {9.66->11.58}And heart is what Super Earth {11.95->12.74}is all about. {13.46->14.95}Prove your humanity. {15.53->16.70}Show you care. {18.28->18.76}Enlist {19.22->20.99}in the Super Earth Armed Forces {21.56->23.70}and destroy the Automaton threat!
{0.00->0.95}Loadout confirmed.
{0.06->2.46}I've never seen a Helldiver up close before.
{0.00->2.00}This fence is restricting our Freedom!
{0.00->0.76}Aerial enemy.
{0.00->1.63}Helldivers never die.
{0.02->1.06}Enemy outpost.
{0.00->3.08}Make them pay...!
{0.00->0.88}Are we nearly there?
{0.00->1.41}Liberty will prevail.
{0.00->0.28}Here.
{0.07->1.23}Super Uranium. {1.64->4.08}Defier of gravity and extremely safe.
{0.00->1.20}I hope it hurt.
{0.03->1.35}The bugs are coming!
{0.03->2.97}That thing you want? Go ahead, buy it. {3.34->5.17}That's how you support the economy. {5.61->8.08}That's how you support Super Earth.
{0.01->1.91}Gotta find somewhere safe to wait this out.
{0.14->3.32}Super Earth will never fall to the likes of you!
{0.00->0.95}Squid outpost.
{0.01->2.73}Front-row seats to watch the Helldivers in action!
{0.00->0.38}Thank you.
{0.00->0.83}Manned emplacement.
{0.00->1.87}Live to dive another day.
{0.00->0.79}Not engaging.
{0.00->0.76}Got a sample.
{0.00->1.73}Support weapon inbound.
{0.01->1.93}Don't worry. The Helldivers are here.
{0.01->1.46}We got company!!!
{0.01->0.98}Changing I.C.E.
{0.00->2.70}It's the Helldivers! We're saved!
{0.00->1.78}I'll remember this forever.
{0.03->1.03}Objective equipment.
{0.02->0.69}Second one.
{0.02->0.66}I'm sorry!
{0.00->2.05}Helldivers never die.
{0.12->1.39}How far are we going?
{0.00->1.12}Calling down a sentry.
{0.00->0.65}Got one.
{0.00->1.68}Democracy's dignity maintained.
{0.04->4.24}Hm...Floor looks clean...for now.
{0.00->2.32}The Helldivers are fighting alongside us!
{0.01->1.66}Reloading! Cover me!
{0.00->1.62}Reinforcement ready to fire.
{0.00->1.27}I'll never forget this.
{0.00->1.47}Managed Democracy will endure.
{0.12->5.85}Status: Liberation from Terminids underway. Helldiver support requested.
{0.00->6.51}Let them come. Let them brawl. Let them face the insurmountable might of the Helldivers.
{0.00->5.59}Did you know? The scientific term for a group of squids is "A Massacre of Illuminate." {5.98->11.04}All such groups should indeed be massacred as outlined in the proactive defense initiative,{11.15->13.01}chapter 19, section d.
{0.03->1.90}I knew they wouldn't abandon us.
{0.00->1.38}Who's still with us!?
{0.00->1.31}Gas strike incoming.
{0.00->1.65}The Fort Justice system
{0.03->1.32}Terminids!
{0.00->0.92}Liberty above. {1.44->3.95}I can't believe the enemy thinks they can invade Super Earth.
{0.00->0.37}Up.
{0.00->1.75}Squid teleportation incoming!
{0.00->1.39}The Senge system
{0.07->1.19}It's the Helldivers!
{0.01->3.98}Contributing... to the Cause!
{0.02->1.01}Keep shooting!
{0.00->1.56}Let's settle the score!
{0.03->0.56}Echo
{0.00->6.16}Give everything to the cause! Remember, apathy is Liberty's greatest enemy.
{0.12->2.61}Will the shuttle have enough room for all of us?
{0.00->2.56}When I was a kid, I always loved All Heroes' Eve.
{0.00->0.85}What about here?
{0.00->1.46}Democracy's elite{1.54->2.33}in action!
{0.00->1.90}Will the shuttle have enough room for all of us?
{0.00->2.34}Another sample collected for Democracy.
{0.04->2.28}Warning: you are leaving the mission area.
{0.00->0.40}Nine.
{0.02->3.70}Alert: Liberation of currently orbited planet from {4.08->11.48}Terminid menace has ended in absolute victory. Planet now under Super Earth control.
{0.02->1.35}Team reload required.
{0.00->1.43}The Mintoria system
{0.00->1.42}Engaging orbital laser.
{0.00->1.34}We have to keep moving.
{0.00->1.22}Dropping high-value item.
{0.07->2.10}Those poor Super Earth citizens.
{0.00->4.35}I heard back when they were testing 'em, one malfunctioned and sucked someone's...{4.87->6.71}well, you can imagine what happened.
{0.00->1.74}Flag-forsaken robot.
{0.00->1.32}Calling in mission shuttle.
{0.00->1.77}Take a moment to remember: {2.86->5.12}Super Earth loves you.
{0.00->2.38}Ready to dispense Democracy.
{0.00->1.39}Calling down supplies.
{0.03->2.61}Civic duty at its finest.
{0.00->1.28}Freedom five!
{0.00->3.71}The bugs seek to turn this planet into another gelatinous hive. {4.18->5.78}Do not let them succeed.
{0.00->1.71}Can you believe the election's comin' up?
{0.00->1.30}The Azterra system
{0.18->3.58}We do not yet know how the Voteless were created. {4.03->8.95}It seems the Illuminate wish to transform our citizens' minds and bodies. {9.65->13.82}But are these monstrosities the end of their gruesome experimentation...{14.49->16.94}or merely the beginning?
{0.00->0.55}Negative!
{0.00->1.80}Kill them! Kill them all!
{0.02->1.79}For Liberty's sake, shoot them!
{0.00->6.87}History matters! At the end of the First Galactic War, we magnanimously allowed the Illuminate to {6.87->8.15}flee the Galaxy. {8.51->10.09}Now they're back. {10.48->11.14}Why? {11.55->13.23}Because they hate peace.
{0.00->1.11}That's for Meridia.
{0.01->1.68}We're gonna be ok.
{0.00->2.79}Helldivers! We can't lose!
{0.02->0.92}Get down!
{0.03->4.26}That operation earned the recognition of Super Earth High Command.
{0.00->1.34}The Cirrus system
{0.01->2.00}Additional extraction point located.
{0.00->1.57}Freedom guide us!
{0.00->1.38}A little shot o' Liberty.
{0.00->0.86}I'm out!
{0.00->0.49}Six.
{0.00->1.33}I'll remember this forever.
{0.00->0.54}On my way.
{0.00->0.37}North.
{0.00->1.35}Super Uranium acquired.
{0.04->4.95}Reminder: signs of disloyalty should be reported to the Democracy Officer.
{0.02->0.77}Third one.
{0.00->1.61}The Helldivers are here!
{0.01->1.22}More Automatons!
{0.02->1.07}The squids are back!
{1.60->3.75}Your vote is your voice. {5.20->7.23}Don't let it go to waste.
{0.00->0.74}I need ammo.
{0.02->0.90}Take cover!
{0.02->0.97}It's the Illuminate!
{0.03->0.82}What is that?
{0.00->1.95}Tactical asset near your location.
{0.00->1.51}Danger. Danger.
{0.15->0.68}But soon, {1.10->5.21}Danny started to dislike his old friends, because they didn't know all the secrets he knew.
{0.07->0.93}SOS!
{0.04->2.12}Kill them! Kill them all!
{0.61->0.75}You {1.38->1.75}guys do this all the time. Right?
{0.01->2.80}Victory for Super Earth is victory for all!
{0.00->0.95}Reinforcing.
{0.00->1.38}Not so advanced now, huh?
{0.00->3.36}We have failed to repel the enemy's assault upon this planet. {3.74->7.62}We must regroup, and break the foothold they acquired today.
{0.00->1.64}Legendarium acquired.
{0.00->2.55}Another strike against Tyranny!
{0.00->3.41}Crushed under the heel of Justice. As they should be.
{0.15->1.24}Freedom forever.
{0.00->7.29}Every day, millions of soldiers have their names inscribed upon the Wall of Martyrs. {7.76->9.34}Show your support. {9.90->13.91}Purchase one of Super Earth's exclusive Martyrs Day Celebration packages!
{0.07->1.39}The Oasis system
{0.01->0.77}Understood.
{0.00->1.80}High-value sample collected.
{0.00->1.46}Calling down fortifications.
{0.00->1.39}The Cerberus system
{0.00->1.15}Calling in extraction.
{0.00->1.95}Abolish Tyranny!
{0.00->3.74}And now, another helpful tip from General Brasch.{6.20->9.10}Young bucks always think they're invincible.{9.32->12.53}And while they are mostly right, the fact of the matter is{12.60->16.11}that Helldivers with broken arms cannot aim.{16.30->19.45}Helldivers with broken legs cannot run.{20.13->23.20}And Helldivers with serious injuries to their vital organs{23.70->27.27}will bleed out before they can say "Death to my enemies."{28.39->33.54}So next time you find yourself unable to run, aim, or stay alive,{33.94->37.01}stick yourself with a STIM, soldier!{39.05->43.01}BRASCH TACTICS! Use 'em, or die trying.
{0.00->1.95}Freedom thanks you, Helldiver.
{0.00->0.95}Gotta swap batteries.
{0.00->0.76}Southeast.
{0.03->1.83}The Helldivers came for us!
{0.02->2.08}Freedom's...fortitude!
{0.00->2.47}Extraction Request confirmed. Shuttle inbound.
{0.00->1.46}Calling down equipment.
{0.00->1.87}This will all be over soon.
{0.00->1.45}Orbital strike incoming.
{0.03->1.08}Illuminate!
{0.85->2.26}Is there a bunker around here?
{0.00->1.13}And stay down!
{7.93->10.44}Good evening, I'm Coretta Kelly.{11.11->17.44}The Ministry of Expansion released an evacuation warning for planets near the Meridian Singularity,{17.57->21.33}following a sharp spike in Dark Energy radiation.{21.94->28.88}Experts believe that the wormhole has been held open by a constant flow of Dark Energy from the Illuminate invaders.{29.25->38.07}Now, it appears that flow has ceased, resulting in an unstable singularity on the verge of catastrophic collapse.{38.62->46.20}The Ministry of Truth states that "this is the latest act of vile escalation from the Illuminate Cult.{46.55->51.49}Super Earth will not be terrorized by a spacetime-warping bomb."{52.24->57.66}Citizens on affected planets are advised to report signs of Dark Energy radiation sickness,{57.84->62.89}such as boils, floating, and loss of Democratic reasoning.{63.26->66.97}That's Liberty's Latest; I'm Coretta Kelly.
{0.08->2.75}It's like they're programmed to hate Democracy.
{0.00->0.05}I got the terminal.
{0.04->2.04}Oh no, bots!
{0.02->1.70}Kill it! Destroy it!
{0.00->0.81}You're here. {1.21->3.32}The galaxy awaits your salvation.
{0.00->2.67}Wow. Nobody is gonna believe this.
{0.01->2.21}Bugs! They're gonna eat us!!
{0.00->2.05}Live to dive another day.
{0.00->0.55}I'll take it.
{0.04->1.34}That's what I'm talkin' about!
{1.47->2.85}Feel Democracy's warm embrace!
{0.00->3.70}I read a Super Study the other day that said video games increase aggression.
{0.01->1.86}Uh - For Super Earth!
{0.00->1.22}Poor bastard...
{0.00->0.71}Super Earth still needs you!
{0.00->2.23}Keeping things running around here isn't easy, {2.60->4.57}but if that's how I can best serve Liberty, {4.96->6.37}I'll do it gladly.
{0.00->1.45}Performing assisted reload.
{0.02->1.63}Now we have a chance!
{0.00->0.79}I'm on the terminal.
{0.00->0.37}Yes
{0.00->1.04}Flag acquired.
{0.00->0.80}Out of stims.
{0.00->7.51}Helldivers. Protectors of humanity. Paragons of democracy. Heroes to their very core. {8.13->10.20}Do you have what it takes?
{0.02->0.92}Canister's empty.
{0.00->2.95}Our Class-A citizens clamor for aid.
{0.00->0.71}Hail!
{0.00->1.15}We're safe!
{0.02->2.08}Hope Sarge didn't see that...
{0.00->1.25}How'd you like the taste of Freedom?
{0.00->3.81}This planet calls out to be freed from the robots that enslave it. {4.40->6.86}Choose where you will shatter its shackles.
{0.02->1.00}The bugs are coming!
{0.00->2.94}Good thing someone called for reinforcements during extraction. {3.31->3.96}Otherwise, {4.42->5.63}nobody would have made it back.
{0.01->1.64}They knew what they signed up for.
{0.02->0.99}Keep shooting!
{0.03->2.74}Another perfect day to defend Freedom.
{0.00->1.64}Calling down fortifications.
{0.00->2.90}This world is riddled with Terminid abominations. {3.54->4.92}Where will you strike first?
{0.00->2.05}You really are incredible.
{0.03->1.62}The Alairt system
{0.01->1.79}Peacekeeping at its finest!
{0.00->1.79}That's called Democracy!
{0.00->0.50}Sample.
{0.00->1.61}The city is lost.{2.09->5.86}Its graceful high-rise buildings, in ruins.
{0.02->1.29}More Illuminate!
{0.06->1.23}When's the shuttle coming?
{0.00->4.92}Even though the First Galactic War ended nearly a hundred years ago now, Managed Democracy has {4.92->7.95}stayed vigilant. Exactly for developments like these.
{0.00->4.14}Every system will soon exult in the glory of Managed Democracy.
{0.00->2.27}Should've stayed out of our city, scum.
{0.00->3.95}Eagle 1 reporting in. Ready to bury some aliens neck-deep in Liberty.
{0.00->0.88}Dropping package.
{0.00->0.43}Ouch.
{0.00->3.41}Recruit expired. Request human remains disposal team.
{0.00->1.06}We're saved.
{0.64->1.13}Please...{2.15->2.95}please...
{0.00->0.83}Local fauna.
{0.00->1.13}Pretty low interest rate, too.
{0.03->0.70}Follow me!
{0.00->0.95}Weapons ready.
{0.11->0.99}Sweet Liberty. {1.45->3.08}Super Earth…overrun.
{0.00->1.76}My life for Super Earth!
{0.03->1.56}Get it off of me!
{0.02->2.58}The invaders are here!
{0.00->0.58}Got one.
{0.00->1.31}Rare sample acquired.
{0.00->2.14}Ready for another mission, Helldiver?
{2.99->6.69}You crash on an uncharted planet. Stranded. {7.07->9.12}Lightyears from Liberty. {9.95->10.74}Then you hear them. {11.69->16.35}They're almost on you, teeth gnashing, venom glistening in the twin moonlight. {17.08->20.63}Suddenly you remember the one thing that can save you.{21.53->23.32}Eagle Sweat. {23.73->28.25}One spray, and the world shifts. You mount the beasts and rise,{28.35->32.40}master of your domain, a god among the cosmos.{32.78->35.97}Before long, you are home.{36.25->37.81}Eagle Sweat.{38.39->43.57}With patented nano-fragrance technology that literally puts odor molecules{43.58->47.97}to the rack until they give up their secrets.{48.90->54.18}Eagle Sweat. Don't just smell it. Live it.
{0.00->2.08}I've never seen a Helldiver up close before.
{0.00->0.66}I'm sorry.
{0.00->0.40}3!
{0.00->0.65}Look out!
{0.02->0.88}To the skies.
{0.00->0.86}That was awesome!
{3.83->4.87}Good Evening, I'm your {5.23->6.33}host, Coretta Kelly.{7.19->12.34}What you're looking at here is recently-released footage from the Ministry of Defense showing an {12.51->15.76}interstellar object that seems to resemble an Illuminate {16.31->17.21}Void Ship.{18.13->22.81}The Illuminate have long been considered eradicated following the First Galactic War, {23.37->28.43}but this video is causing some to question if any somehow survived. {29.04->33.41}Officials say they have not yet confirmed whether the object is truly Illuminate in {33.46->34.07}origin, but that {35.03->37.50}they are considering all possibilities.{38.49->40.95}That's Liberty's Latest; I'm Coretta Kelly.
{0.00->1.86}Pelican 1 returning to extraction point. {2.25->4.56}Please ensure you are inside the extraction radius. 
{0.00->0.56}What about here?
{0.00->1.33}Super Earth{1.78->3.32}will protect me...
{0.00->0.63}I've got you.
{0.00->0.56}Tie.
{0.00->0.95}Last reload.
{6.14->11.13}Good evening, I'm your host, Coretta Kelly, with breaking news.{11.13->15.53}A shocking report from the Ministry of Science has revealed the true{15.53->19.84}nature of the humanoid assailants being used by the Illuminate.{19.84->25.37}These attackers have been confirmed as former Citizens of Super Earth,{25.37->30.55}abducted and transformed into mind-controlled monstrosities.{30.55->40.12}Captured specimens retain no trace of their former selves, showing no recognition of loved ones or the Super Earth flag.{40.12->48.05}These lost souls have been named "The Voteless." Tragically, they are completely beyond saving.{48.05->56.10}Citizens are advised to guard themselves against Illuminate mind control by redoubling their commitment to Democratic Values.{56.10->66.79}As for the Voteless, the Helldivers have been ordered to bring a swift end to their horrific fates, as foot soldiers of a despotic regime.{66.79->77.99}Up next: is ordering calamari patriotic, or evidence of Illuminate mind control?  Stay tuned.
{0.00->2.46}Democracy cannot be{2.94->3.95}denied...
{0.00->1.63}Need to do something about my arm.
{0.00->0.67}Dropships.
{0.00->1.44}What will happen to Democracy now?
{0.01->0.77}Mag's empty.
{0.01->2.26}Sweet Liberty, that stings!
{0.11->1.38}Support weapon inbound.
{0.00->0.51}Got one.
{0.00->0.43}I'm out.
{0.00->0.54}Affirmative.
{0.00->2.95}Allied Destroyer joining squadron. Deploying Helldiver.
{0.01->3.30}They're here! They're disgusting!
{0.00->1.42}The Osupsam system
{0.00->2.29}Cape looks extra sharp today, Helldiver.
{0.00->1.84}Liberty is an onrushing wave. {2.37->4.40}One obstacle will not stop us.
{0.00->1.02}Requesting walker.

{0.03->2.19}Sweet Liberty, it's the bots!

{1.31->4.10}It doesn't matter who you are or where you were born—{4.86->8.47}all citizens are equal in the eyes of freedom. {9.05->11.43}Which is why Super Earth's most patriotic minds{11.50->15.19}instituted the Citizenship Classification Structure. {15.73->17.12}Thanks to the CCS, {17.28->21.27}we can determine exactly which citizens are the most equal. {21.64->26.60}Continue your war efforts, and one day you too could reach Class A citizenship. {27.21->27.97}The CCS: {28.99->30.58}Liberty Optimized.

{0.00->0.96}Welcome back. {1.32->4.37}The Terminids you defeated will soon fuel the war effort.
{0.00->2.02}Rest in pain, dirtbag.
{0.00->1.94}The Alderidge Cove system
{0.00->1.41}I'm never washing this hand.
{0.00->1.15}That's just good engineering.
{0.00->2.79}YOU DELIVER THAT DEMOCRACY, HELLDIVER!!
{0.01->0.92}Get down!
{0.02->0.97}The bots are here!
{0.00->0.64}Will the shuttle have enough room for all of us?
{0.00->2.95}I swear those freaks get stronger every day.
{0.03->1.33}There's more of them!

{0.09->1.76}Unidentified enemy contact.
{0.05->4.02}Did they have the story of Dissident Danny where you came from? Went somethin' like this: 
{0.00->4.24}Welcome back. That city is one step closer to Freedom.
{0.01->2.17}Go go go!
{0.00->1.50}Democracy conquers all.
{0.01->2.06}This must be part of Super Earth's plan.
{0.00->0.88}No matter. {1.24->2.97}We shall continue the fight.
{0.00->0.86}Affirmative.
{0.00->0.84}Dead enemy.{1.22->2.94}Best thing I've seen all day.
{0.00->2.30}I'm not sure what to make of these Automatons. {2.73->6.91}I'm sure they're no match for the Helldivers, but that's no reason for complacency.
{0.00->1.03}New mag.

{0.00->5.99}The function of the Democratic Investigation Agency is to keep you and your family safe. {6.43->9.18}Please, co-operate with their requests.

{0.01->1.09}They're not letting up!
{0.00->0.69}New target?{1.21->2.30}Whatever it takes.

{0.00->5.79}Well done. Lots of enemies killed, and lots of samples to help us figure out how to kill even more.
{0.00->1.32}Reminder: Element {1.70->6.53}710 is safe and environmentally friendly. Any rumors of E-{6.90->11.74}710 spills are the work of dissidents seeking to undermine our way of life.
{0.00->1.95}I don't think you should do that again.
{0.00->0.57}New mag.

{0.05->0.51}I'm out!

{0.03->2.08}It wants my brain!
{0.00->3.49}Man, whoever designed this was a Democracy-loving genius.
{0.00->3.81}At least I saw the Helldivers...
{0.00->3.26}Breathe easy, citizen. We got Helldivers with us.
{0.00->1.95}But one mission remains.

{0.00->0.63}Cancel that.

"{0.00->6.25}In the first intragalactic war alone, the bugs accounted for the deaths of one hundred and eighty-{6.25->8.39}nine million Super Earth citizens. {8.77->9.98}Many of them babies.

{0.00->2.71}Helldiver!? VENGEANCE!
{0.26->1.75}The Helldivers?{2.80->3.76}Oh NOW it's on!
{0.00->0.84}Last reload.
{0.08->1.84}Stay dead, scum.
{1.33->4.29}Ahem. So for this next part, make sure you dive {4.66->8.61}into the trench, and stay down the whole time. {9.24->9.67}That's...{10.92->11.47}that's it.

May Freedom watch over us all.
{0.00->4.11}Our enemies couldn't take down even a single Helldiver today. {5.06->6.94}You truly are invincible.
{0.00->0.95}How much longer?
{0.03->1.22}Get it away from me!
{0.00->0.73}Just stay calm.
{0.38->0.60}Here!
{0.03->1.63}Kill them! Kill them all!

{0.03->1.22}Get down!
{0.09->1.05}Until now! {1.45->9.35}Here's your REAL lesson, soldier: Squadmates can and will perish tragically all the time. Now use {9.35->13.83}the Reinforcement Stratagem to have another Helldiver take their place!

{0.01->2.23}You'll... you'll be okay...
{0.00->1.33}Nice and cold in here.
{0.01->1.22}I'm bleeding out!
{0.00->4.63}They say the Gloom could be enabling some kind of bug swarm intelligence.{5.25->9.72}Well, I'm not worried. They got a long way to go before they even come close to being as smart as{9.80->10.16}us.
{0.06->2.29}For Liberty's sake, shoot them!
{0.00->0.66}Northwest.
{0.02->1.09}I'll be fine...
{0.00->5.37}Bugs, as essential as they are vile. Never forget, Element {5.79->9.69}710 extraction is just as important as eradication!
{0.00->0.63}No!
{0.00->0.60}I'm sorry.
{0.00->1.30}Pelican 1 approaching pickup. 
{0.01->1.29}This is the objective.

{0.01->1.73}Go! Move!
{0.00->2.78}That operation was a heavy blow to the Terminid forces.
{0.00->0.60}Reloading.
{3.11->4.56}To die for the cause... no greater...honor...
{0.09->1.72}We'll Liberate 'em soon enough.
{0.00->3.26}Our way of life will always endure...
{0.00->2.33}I hope we kill every last one of 'em.
{0.00->7.88}Report all signs of dissidence to your local loyalty officer. Remember—heroes report, cowards stay {7.90->8.67}silent.
{0.00->2.14}Injury? What injury!
{0.00->2.29}Let's see this through, for Super Earth.
{0.00->2.11}You better go give 'em a proper Helldiver welcome.
{0.01->3.03}This... isn't the end.
{0.01->3.34}That was almost as exciting as Liberty Day.
{0.01->0.97}The bots are back!
{0.01->1.22}Throwing supply beacon.
{0.00->3.27}We can't all be Helldivers, but we can all serve the cause.

{0.05->1.56}What in Liberty's name!?
{0.00->1.71}Legendary iridescence.
{0.45->3.27}For a minute, I thought I might never vote again.

{0.00->2.63}You truly are one of Liberty's greatest heroes.
{0.00->3.80}Be advised, the enemy High Priority Target is near your position.
{0.06->1.55}Back! Back!
{0.00->3.70}Your sample collection is of great value to the Ministry of Science. {4.19->6.18}Everything serves Liberty, in the end. {6.61->8.29}Even our enemies.
{0.00->2.01}Our requests have been answered!
{0.00->2.40}I hope they died in pain.

{0.00->0.84}Let's play.
{0.00->1.58}Performing assisted reload.
{0.00->1.30}Welcome aboard, Helldiver. {1.81->3.30}The Galactic War needs you.
{0.00->0.30}Right.
{0.34->1.90}Terrorize THIS!
{0.00->1.53}This is the right place. Right?
{0.17->2.22}For the glory of Super Earth.
{0.02->0.91}Fire in the hole.
{0.00->3.60}Hold your breath!
{0.00->1.10}They're coming soon, right?
{0.00->1.29}Wish I could ride in one of these.
{0.00->2.08}Wonder if this'll help my next CCS review...
{0.00->1.07}I better get back to work.
{0.00->1.47}Bot asset destroyed.
{0.00->1.54}I did my part...
{0.00->0.42}Yes!
{0.00->1.24}You saved us!
{0.00->1.70}Great shot, Helldiver!
{0.00->3.48}Danny read everything he could get his hands on, always tryin' to discover something that {3.48->3.70}no one else knew.
{0.00->1.07}Objective located.
{0.01->4.41}Attack Democracy, you pay the price!
{0.00->1.92}Are you sure it's safe here?

{0.82->2.13}Just like in the movies...
{1.40->2.04}I'm hit..{3.20->3.75}I'm hit...
{0.00->1.32}Just stay calm.
{0.01->1.09}Prepare for contact.
{0.00->0.49}Sample.
{0.00->1.09}For Super Earth!
{0.05->2.12}GET SOOOOOOME!
{0.02->1.59}That's called Democracy!
{0.00->2.95}Decreased visibility—should help obscure our movements.
{0.00->0.45}Zero.

{0.00->3.23}I never thought I'd get to meet an actual Helldiver.
{0.25->0.68}Step {1.11->2.99}57: check oil levels. {4.00->4.61}Lookin' good.
{0.02->2.33}Will the shuttle have enough room for all of us?
{0.02->0.99}Robot scum!
{0.01->1.19}Sweet Liberty!
{0.04->2.38}Get away from me, bug freak!
{0.00->1.26}The Karlia system
{0.00->1.21}Making progress.
{0.00->1.66}High-value sample collected.
{0.00->1.50}You got a favorite Super Earth show? {1.86->2.65}I love all of 'em.
{0.02->8.52}Remember: as long as you fight for Super Earth - you matter.{8.52->15.34}If you stop, you don't. But you are - and you do.
{0.01->1.02}I can't!
{0.00->0.28}Two.
{0.00->3.29}We will not allow our planets to fall into their tentacles.
{0.04->3.02}Wonder which candidate'll be selected for me in this upcomin' election.
{0.01->2.09}Compliments of Super Earth!
{0.00->6.34}If they could speak, I know our heroes would not have us mourn their loss, but rejoice in their {6.42->7.16}victory.
{0.00->0.76}That's not good.
{0.02->1.53}The Myradesh system
{0.06->1.48}Thank you for saving us.
{0.00->5.29}Well fought, soldiers. You've pried their tentacles from the throat of Liberty.
{0.00->3.36}I don't blame them—all of us had Helldiver posters all over our bedrooms growin' up.
{0.99->2.20}Where are the evac ships?
{7.93->13.92}Citizens of Super Earth, I come to you today with joyous, wondrous news.{14.42->19.20}Super Earth, our home, is FREE once more.{19.74->23.10}Following days of fierce fighting, the brave,{23.35->27.13}heroic Helldivers drove off the Illuminate invaders,{27.37->30.86}repelling them to the depths of the Milky Way.{31.07->37.73}The President of Super Earth has released a statement: "We always knew this day would come.{37.87->49.19}The light of Managed Democracy may be dimmed for a while, but it can NEVER go out—so long as our patriotism and fealty remain absolute."{49.96->58.94}Displaced Class-A refugees return to homes destroyed, skyscrapers twisted into Illuminate abominations.{59.19->66.13}Emergency funds have been diverted to ensure restoration efforts can proceed without delay.{66.66->71.42}And, following a referendum to ensure the future safety of Super Earth,{71.89->77.43}those suspected of dissident thought will now be automatically sent to the front lines.{78.13->81.85}I'm Coretta Kelly; May Freedom watch over us,{82.21->87.51}and may Freedom watch over the Federation of Super Earth.
{0.00->0.60}Dropships!
{0.00->1.42}Bot outpost spotted.
{0.83->1.29}The Helldivers are here!
{0.00->1.74}They lease 'em out to me, so I can do my job.
{0.00->1.30}Not today!
{0.01->2.08}Enemy sighted. Prepare to engage.
{0.00->2.48}Without the Super Earth–approved messages on this here TV, {2.85->4.26}I'd have no idea what to think.
{0.00->2.38}Flag-forsaken Fascist.
{0.00->1.03}Operation complete. {1.63->3.95}Super Earth High Command has commended us.
{4.03->7.31}Freedom's Greetings, I'm your host, Coretta Kelly.{7.98->14.06}Helldivers continue efforts to eradicate the Automaton threat in Operation Swift Disassembly.{14.75->19.92}The Minister of Defense has indicated that the operation's goal is the total destruction of all {19.94->21.56}Automatons, saying{21.98->23.47}"Peace is not an option. The {24.02->26.40}Automatons are programmed for 2 things: {26.77->28.96}violence, and hating Freedom."{29.83->30.73}Coming up next: {31.21->33.60}are toilet stalls dissident hideouts? {34.21->35.70}More on that, when we return.
{0.23->2.22}You guys do this all the time. Right?
{0.00->6.41}They may have taken our City of Hope, but they will never take the Hope in our hearts.{7.04->9.90}Nor the Conviction in our spines.{10.33->14.93}Nor the Democratic Belief running throughout our lymphatic systems.
{0.12->1.21}Sweet Liberty!
{0.00->1.91}Freedom never falters.
{0.00->2.68}You came to right place. Much safer here.
{0.03->1.03}We have to keep moving.
{0.00->1.17}Requesting supplies.
{0.00->0.78}Welcome back. {1.19->3.47}Our enemies will run out of steam soon enough.
{0.00->1.61}It's not much, but I donate {2.12->5.48}15% of every one of my paychecks to the War Fund. It's the least I can do.
{0.00->3.52}You will forever be remembered as heroes of this metropolis.

{0.00->3.21}Burn in the fires of Democracy!
{0.03->0.72}Squids!
{0.00->0.25}I don't think I can do that.
{0.05->1.51}What are those things?
{0.02->1.64}Contact! Stand by!
{0.00->1.25}Calling down support weapon.
{0.00->0.39}Here.

{0.00->0.79}Enemy spotted.
{0.03->1.27}Help me!
{0.13->1.26}I need stims.
{0.02->1.33}It's gonna cut me open!
{0.00->0.71}Dropping a pin.
{0.00->0.76}How much longer?
{0.00->2.32}Gotta fix this Liberty-forsaken arm.
{0.04->2.48}Sweet Liberty, it's the Helldivers!
{0.03->1.32}This is crazy!
{0.00->0.75}Changing I.C.E.
{0.00->2.16}Retribution will find you!
{0.00->9.83}You are here. You are home. You are aboard your very own Super Destroyer.
{0.01->1.37}That's why they're the best!
{0.00->1.32}The Klaka system

{0.00->1.18}Greetings, Helldiver. {1.60->3.44}The Galactic War awaits.
{0.00->1.14}Illuminate teleporting in.
{0.00->0.66}Fourth one.
{0.03->1.12}Get us out of here!
{0.00->2.17}I've never seen a Helldiver up close before.
{0.02->1.48}When's the shuttle coming?
{0.00->1.82}Your name will live on in history.
{0.01->1.58}Crush them!
{0.00->0.76}Critical item.
{0.01->0.62}Here!
{0.00->0.61}Illuminate.
{0.00->2.45}I knew the Helldivers would protect us.
{0.00->1.49}The Duma Tyr system
{0.02->3.95}You are a true champion of Democracy.
{0.02->1.93}Freedom owes you a debt.
{0.00->1.46}Manning combat walker.
{0.00->0.62}Nice.
{0.00->2.27}Yeah! You squash that bug!
{0.08->5.31}Stake Super Earth's claim, Helldiver; make the Ministry of Expansion proud.
{0.01->1.58}NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
{0.01->0.63}Here!
{0.10->2.85}That... was close...
{0.23->4.95}Studies on captured Voteless have begun to yield insight into their creation. {5.54->9.66}Their DNA has been altered, resulting in physical deformities. {10.16->14.73}Their minds, meanwhile, bear the marks of extreme thought control. {15.26->22.76}Similar to our own patriotic re-education protocols...but twisted into something profane.
{0.11->7.69}Hold up, recruit. It's finally time to call in the big guns. Use the support weapon stratagem to {7.69->9.69}get yourself a real weapon.
{0.00->1.72}This city needs our aid.
{0.00->0.53}Bug hole.
{0.00->1.49}Bug Tunnel breach detected!
{0.01->0.60}I'm out!
{0.00->1.27}I thought you'd never ask!
{0.07->3.95}Those fanatics won't stop until the entire galaxy is eatin' brains for breakfast.
{0.00->1.91}I'll need to requisition some more Hellpods.
{0.03->3.46}They killed a Helldiver...We're all gonna die!

{0.00->1.35}Look, a good bug.
{0.01->2.27}The Galaxy embraces us.{2.27->11.98}When its nonhuman inhabitants try to murder you on sight, they are a disturbance to the natural order.{11.98->13.87}Super Earth's order.

{0.02->3.57}My legs! For the love of Liberty, my legs!
{0.00->0.21}Gotta {0.59->1.95}patch up this leg.

{0.00->1.28}I'll never forget this.
{0.34->0.95}Kill them all!
{0.00->1.64}Calling down support weapon.
{0.00->1.68}Point me to the enemy.
{0.00->1.52}The great leveler --{1.90->3.57}Hellbomb secured.
{0.00->1.95}Hellbomb armed—clear the area.
{0.00->3.01}Remain ever-vigilant for deceit and treachery. {3.73->6.27}They can take root in the smallest of cracks.
{0.00->0.59}Fifth one.
{0.00->4.21}You have ignited the torches of Liberty. Extraction awaits.
{0.00->0.70}Boom!{0.82->3.53}Another alien interloper in the ground!
{0.00->0.81}We're saved.
{1.15->3.09}Many hands make Liberty work.
{0.00->1.92}This time, they're never gonna come back.
{0.00->0.75}Sixth one.
{0.08->2.95}I hope we kill every last one of those squids.
{0.00->1.67}The Vindemitarix system
{0.05->3.80}If I were a Helldiver, I think my favorite enemy to kill would be the Illuminate.
{0.01->1.51}Might've cast my last Vote...
{0.00->1.25}The Hadar system
{0.00->3.48}The tides of Liberty will sweep these streets clean.
{0.00->0.84}You're back quickly. {1.29->1.95}Well done.
{0.00->3.18}NO ENEMY OF FREEDOM WALKS AWAY FROM THIS!
{0.01->1.45}It sounds worse than it is.
{0.00->1.12}Need more ammo!
{0.00->1.83}The enemies on the battlefield are one thing, {2.31->3.69}but at least they're out in the open. {4.29->7.06}It's the traitors among us I truly hate.
{0.00->0.10}I'm out.
{0.01->1.74}Freedom never sleeps!
{0.01->1.93}For the glory of Super Earth!
{0.00->1.23}A Hellbomb!{1.79->3.15}NOW we're talking!
{0.00->0.67}Rolling out!
{0.00->1.24}The Keid system
{0.01->0.76}Over there!
{0.00->1.05}Jump complete.
{0.00->1.82}Sweet Liberty that was close!
{0.00->0.60}I'm out.
{0.00->4.56}My algorithmically selected candidate didn't win this time, but hey, sometimes Managed Democracy {4.56->6.10}works in mysterious ways.
{0.00->2.07}ETA T-30 seconds.
{0.02->0.75}Over here!
{0.00->0.74}New canister.
{0.05->0.92}Stimming you.
{0.00->2.86}Make sure you show it the proper respect!
{0.00->1.72}United we stand!
{0.09->5.32}I wish I could see the look on the squid's faces, right before they explode.
{0.00->1.52}The tentacles!
{0.02->0.93}Found something.
{0.00->1.13}Anything you ask!
{0.00->0.39}East.
{0.00->1.39}The Ratch system
{0.00->0.49}Bravo
{0.00->2.96}Here you may assess the current state of the Galactic War. {3.71->8.95}The conflict rages across many sectors. It is up to you where to lend your aid.
{0.31->1.15}The price...{1.99->3.13}of Freedom...
{0.04->2.00}The might of Super Earth!
{0.00->0.93}Bot fabricator.
{0.00->2.38}Firing orbital barrage. Clear the area.
{0.21->1.82}Uh, may I have your attention please: {2.41->5.96}you may be required to dive to the ground to pass your training. {6.52->7.14}Please resume.
{0.00->1.66}I'm bleeding out!
{0.00->2.49}The citizens of this city will thank you.
{0.00->4.27}Operations like that are what will ultimately bring an end to the Terminids.
{0.00->0.34}Zero.
{0.00->3.15}I couldn't live with myself if a Helldiver got killed by their own equipment.
{0.00->2.69}Democracy prevails once more.
{0.00->0.92}Package acquired.
{0.00->1.78}I fight for Freedom.
{0.01->2.26}GRENADE! Stay back!
{0.00->3.45}The Destroyer is mighty, but it's not Super Earth's greatest weapon. {4.14->4.65}No, {5.16->7.07}that is Managed Democracy—{7.47->10.66}the one thing our enemies can never understand.
{0.00->1.82}High Priority Target eliminated.
{0.00->4.47}Today the light of Liberty will grace the skies of this world once more.
{0.06->1.15}Is that really them?
{0.20->2.02}I earned a few more Citizenship points the other day.
{0.02->1.56}Feels gooooood.
{0.00->1.80}Should've stayed home, scum!
{0.00->4.22}Helldivers across the galaxy are fighting for every inch of territory. {4.90->6.03}Where will you join them?
{0.53->1.83}Son of a dissident!
{0.00->6.23}Have any of your friends or family members been behaving unpatriotically? If so, report them to {6.23->9.73}your local Loyalty Officer for immediate reeducation. {10.11->13.48}Remember, Freedom dies in Silence!

{0.00->0.84}A Helldiver?{1.27->2.67}Sir or uh, Ma'am,{3.23->4.65}it is the GREATEST honor.
{0.00->3.77}At long last, we have located the source of the Gloom.{4.42->9.87}This year of noble strife against a disembodied foe has borne fruit.
{0.01->3.21}Tell my family...to vote...
{0.01->4.90}We can do no more for this city today. The mission is failed.
{0.00->1.12}I need a team reload.
{0.00->2.95}Melt them down! Turn 'em into something useful!
{0.00->1.17}The Azur system

{0.01->0.99}The bots are here!
{0.00->2.91}Sometimes I like to come out here and check on my home planet.
{0.00->0.72}Nailed 'em!

{0.02->1.78}Flag-forsaken robots!
{0.00->0.87}Interesting.
{0.00->1.68}Liberty for every being.
{0.01->1.95}Was that them? That was them.
{0.00->4.53}We're fighting three fronts: the Terminids on one side, the Automatons on the other...{4.91->7.46}and the Illuminate, who seem to be everywhere.
{0.00->0.91}Swapping battery.
{0.02->2.25}Get back, you filthy squids!

{5.29->9.71}Good evening, I’m your host, Coretta Kelly, with breaking news.{9.71->21.86}In a shocking development, the anti-Democratic aliens known as the Illuminate have been confirmed as responsible for multiple simultaneous attacks across the galaxy.{21.86->28.25}The advanced and highly xenophobic beings were thought exterminated in the First Galactic War.{28.25->30.45}But according to the Ministry of Defense,{30.45->38.15}their survival indicates that our children and our Freedom are now more at risk than ever before.{38.15->41.95}The Helldivers deployed immediately in response to the Illuminate,{41.95->46.15}and have already killed many of the intolerant, squid-like terrorists,{46.15->48.84}while taking minimal casualties.{48.84->54.98}That’s Liberty’s Latest; I’m Coretta Kelly.
{0.01->0.95}Sample collected.
{0.01->0.91}I'm hit!
{0.17->1.07}I was just thinking: {1.58->6.24}warping across the Federation like this would be impossible without Element 710. {7.11->9.44}Which comes from the bugs themselves. {10.02->14.60}Their own corpses are fueling the creation of more corpses...{16.87->18.30}something satisfying about that.
{0.02->0.52}Help!
{0.00->1.68}Democracy conquers all.
{0.03->0.85}R-really?
{0.03->1.30}Robot scum!
{0.00->1.84}Want me to go lure in some hostiles?
{0.00->2.33}AGH! EARS RINGING!
{0.00->1.51}The Caramoor system
{0.13->2.20}I wonder if people dream in cryosleep.

{0.04->1.55}What are those things?
{0.30->1.40}I thought you'd never ask!
{0.04->1.49}I don't think I can do that.
{0.00->2.95}When I vote, I'll think of you, Helldiver.
{0.00->1.25}Freedom's greetings!
{0.08->1.85}Look up in the sky, recruit; {2.47->4.78}that there is a Super Destroyer, {5.29->9.27}and its all-powerful Stratagems are yours to command.

{0.03->0.89}There's something here.
{0.02->2.52}Moral fortitude will see us through.
{0.01->0.64}Get in!
{0.04->0.89}Helldiver. {1.26->4.81}The time has come to reclaim our stolen galaxy.
{0.00->1.50}Real Helldivers! {3.07->3.17}I don't believe it!
{0.00->2.62}Bug hive spotted. Prepare to exterminate.
{0.02->1.24}This is a nightmare!
{0.07->1.36}Not today!
{0.03->1.47}The tentacles!
{0.00->1.93}High-value sample collected.
{0.00->5.18}The bots are simple enough. Little more than bits of metal welded to a gun and a CPU, with a single {5.18->6.32}overriding directive: {7.01->7.64}kill.
{0.00->0.53}Illuminate.
{0.00->0.75}Second one.
{0.00->1.82}Glad to bolster our ranks.
{0.02->1.13}Protect us!
{0.00->4.68}Hungry? Grab a bag of Prosperitos. A little taste of Freedom {5.11->5.95}in every bite.
{0.00->0.95}Dangerous wildlife.
{0.00->0.50}Seven.
{0.00->3.27}Remember soldiers: waste enemies, not bullets!
{0.03->1.72}Take a moment to remember: {3.76->5.90}Every sacrifice matters.
{0.00->4.86}Terminid scientists say the Gloom facilitates bug communication across the vastness of space.{5.42->12.44}Nothing complicated - just simple signals, like "food here" or "danger," or "I hate Freedom." Stuff{12.44->12.92}like that.
{0.00->2.79}Victory in this operation has eluded our grasp. {3.50->5.74}But our resolve remains firm.
{0.00->1.76}You really are the best of the best.
{0.02->0.96}Coming in hot!
{0.00->0.52}Far.
{0.00->2.40}The squids will find no purchase here.
{0.00->0.63}Southwest.
{0.03->1.69}That's for the Creek.
{0.00->0.95}Package acquired.
{0.00->1.71}Calling in reinforcements!
{0.00->0.73}We've got equipment.
{0.00->1.16}I will remember this{1.63->2.28}forever!
{0.00->1.88}Need team reload!
{0.00->1.35}Establish a perimeter.
{0.00->0.38}Down.
{0.02->0.87}I win.
{0.00->0.48}Four.
{0.00->2.29}Recruit expired. Insert next recruit.
{0.00->1.61}Their deaths will not be in vain, {2.07->5.39}so long as we still have heroes to send to fight.
{0.00->0.95}Dirty bot.
{0.19->1.66}You really are incredible.
{0.00->1.28}Enemy outpost spotted.
{0.03->1.67}The Aladfar system
{0.01->0.44}Ok!
{0.01->0.84}I'm empty!
{0.00->0.78}To the skies.
{0.00->2.11}Keep an eye out for more samples next time.
{0.02->2.91}The squids are gonna eat our brains!
{0.00->2.88}Those un-Democratic freaks found us!
{0.00->1.64}Biological sample secured.
{0.08->1.06}You saved us!
{0.00->2.11}Hellbomb armed—clear the area.
{0.00->2.01}Wonder if this'll help my next CCS review...
{0.03->7.95}Helldivers. Heroes of the federation. Abolishers of tyranny. Legends that secure the Element {8.35->11.47}710 we need to maintain our way of life.
{0.01->2.61}Please help! Please!
{0.04->1.45}The Ilduna system
{0.03->2.08}I wish I could do what you do.
{0.00->1.28}Welcome back, Helldiver. {1.68->5.66}Every successful operation puts us one step closer to ultimate victory. {6.32->7.25}Here's your reward.
{0.00->1.18}Everyone ok?
{0.04->1.45}Well, that's some good news.
{0.00->7.73}Deadeye precision! Now, use a grenade to close up that Bug Hole! Otherwise, they'll just keep {7.76->8.30}comin'.
{0.00->3.27}Visibility improving—avoid being an easy target.
{0.00->0.95}Sample collected.
{0.00->2.66}Pry this city from the enemy's grasp.
{0.14->0.81}Alright!
{0.01->1.03}RUN!
{0.00->2.76}This is Eagle 1, cleared for action and awaiting orders.
{0.00->5.45}I'd say you should've collected more samples, but the Super Destroyer is already fully upgraded.
{0.00->0.95}Out of stims.
{0.00->1.21}Main objective nearby.
{0.00->4.57}Helldivers not at extraction site. Pelican 1 landing aborted. Regaining altitude.
{0.00->2.64}Keep it up, and pretty soon there won't be any bots left. {3.14->4.69}Just Managed Democracy.
{0.00->4.94}Remember, only a firm hand can support the weight of Freedom.
{0.01->0.88}Never let go.
{0.00->0.60}Bots.
{0.00->2.02}Changing course? Something go wrong?
{0.00->1.74}We're here to support, Helldiver.
{0.01->2.23}We will avenge you!!
{0.00->1.72}Looks like we're taking the fight to them --{2.21->3.56}welcome, Helldiver.
{0.00->1.95}Thank you for protecting Super Earth, Helldiver.
{0.02->3.21}Front-row seats to watch the Helldivers in action!
{0.00->0.94}Orbital incoming.
{0.00->0.75}There they are!
{0.01->0.91}I love you.
{0.00->0.69}Sixth one.
{0.00->0.93}You're free now.
{0.00->0.68}Fourth one.
{0.02->0.99}Cover down!
{0.00->1.47}Let the light of Liberty shine!
{0.02->2.20}The Helldivers will make them pay.
{0.00->1.13}Yes! Kill 'em!
{0.08->1.83}Automaton facility destroyed.
{0.00->2.56}That should help keep the bug population in check.
{0.00->5.08}The Hellbot went a little haywire the other day. Started spouting nonsense about its nature, {5.10->8.26}purpose, the meaning of life. I couldn't make heads or tails of it.
{0.01->2.11}Bugs! Run!
{0.00->2.83}Did you come outta one of these? Or? Huh, not {3.78->5.22}sure how this all works really.
{0.00->1.87}Make every shot count!
{0.00->1.78}Main objective near your position.
{0.01->1.69}The Helldivers will save us.
{0.01->1.38}The Helldivers are here!
{0.00->0.42}Ok!
{0.01->2.43}C'mon! Maybe we can find a bunker!
{0.00->0.41}Echo
{0.00->1.23}The Dolph system
{0.00->2.22}Request approved; reinforcements on the way.
{0.02->1.93}What in the name of Freedom?!
{0.06->6.77}Go now, Helldiver. Let our enemies take no step that is not hindered by the corpse of their comrade.
{0.13->5.84}50 billion tons of Termicide, deployed indescriminantly across an entire planet. {6.42->10.15}The genius of the TCS lies in its simplicity.
{0.00->1.25}Black saffron harvested.
{0.03->1.30}I don't think I can do that.
{0.00->1.42}A triumphant return.
{0.04->1.61}Biological sample secured.
{0.00->1.35}I live to serve!
{0.01->2.85}I'd...I'd be honored.
{0.02->0.67}R-really?
{0.01->1.77}Push ahead. City needs our help.
{0.00->1.20}Orbital inbound!

{0.00->2.18}Liberty rests on your shoulders, Helldiver. {2.62->4.21}I know you can bear the weight.
{0.00->0.87}Last reload.
{0.02->1.07}I don't think I can do that.
{0.00->1.51}An unfortunate outcome, {2.18->3.82}but your return gives me hope.
{0.00->1.30}It's the Illuminate!
{0.00->0.87}Never Doubt!
{0.13->4.05}I've been keeping an eye on Citizen Security Surveys. They're looking up.{4.49->7.26}Thanks to our efforts to push back the Gloom, no doubt.
{0.01->2.65}You'll rue the day you came to our city.
{0.02->1.51}The Oshaune system
{0.00->2.30}No fence can tell ME what to do.
{0.00->0.43}North.
{0.00->1.77}High-value sample collected.
{0.04->1.67}That's what I call Justice.
{0.00->3.02}Liberty with a side of Justice, coming up!
{0.00->2.89}The Automatons think this planet is theirs. {3.41->5.25}Show them otherwise.
{0.01->2.32}Helldivers! We're gonna make it!
{0.02->1.57}TASTE FREEDOM!
{0.00->1.48}The Diaspora system
{0.25->4.54}I don't get it. If they're so advanced, why don't they want to be free?
{0.00->0.13}A {0.98->1.92}100% survival rate. {2.54->3.85}Very satisfying.
{0.00->3.44}Make the Automatons pay for their wanton aggression.
{0.00->1.55}Thank Liberty we made it.
{0.00->0.35}Rolling {0.84->1.08}out.
{0.00->1.34}The Pilen system
{0.00->1.78}Flag-forsaken freaks!
{0.01->1.72}I will do it or I will die trying!
{0.06->1.30}Good luck out there! {1.30->2.64}I'll see you on the front lines!
{0.02->1.42}Get it away from me!
{0.02->0.86}Out of ammo.
{0.11->2.34}Yeah!!! KILL 'EM!!!
{0.04->1.42}The Menkent system
{0.00->5.90}Support our troops. Sign your children up for the all-inclusive Helldiver package today!
{0.00->1.33}This is where the shuttle lands?
{0.00->0.44}Negative.
{0.00->2.15}I never thought I'd see Super Earth under attack.
{0.00->2.38}The bugs are basically an out-of-control pest. {2.90->4.18}And you're the exterminator.
{0.00->3.70}At the end of the night, they'd re-enact the Battle of Liberty Peak, and we'd all get cake.
{0.00->0.36}Far.
{0.00->1.41}Throwing supply beacon.
{0.00->0.85}Heading there now.
{0.00->2.24}Note to self: iron trousers.

{0.01->1.14}Get us out of here!
{0.00->2.95}Super Uranium. Safe enough for babies.
{0.01->1.51}I'm bleeding out!
{0.00->2.12}It was never alive to begin with.
{0.00->1.51}The operation has failed. {2.00->3.88}We must try again elsewhere.
{0.00->1.48}Objective completed.

{0.00->3.38}How about a nice cup of liber-tea!
{0.00->1.30}The Pöpli system
{0.00->2.68}The lives of Humanity's present are a crumb; {3.43->6.93}the lives of Humanity's future, a boundless loaf.
{0.08->3.55}You're finally ready for the realest deal of 'em all: {3.95->5.72}The Galactic War. {6.17->9.73}Liberty. Democracy. Justice. {10.20->12.34}They're in your hands now.  {12.74->15.82}General Brasch, over and out.

{8.04->10.63}Good evening, I'm Coretta Kelly.{11.04->16.07}The Meridian Wormhole has been safely collapsed with minimal consequences.{16.36->26.35}The fearless Helldivers enabled the daring launch of the Democracy Space Station—converted into a giant nuclear bomb—into the center of the singularity,{26.53->31.82}where it detonated with over 10 trillion megatons of explosive force.{31.95->35.17}The controlled collapse of the wormhole prevented what{35.17->38.35}could have been an unimaginable catastrophe.{38.74->46.06}The scientists who determined how to collapse to Singularity have been awarded the Presidential Medal of Super Freedom.{46.63->52.69}In a collective statement, they said "We were completely sure this would be safe.{52.95->57.23}It's no surprise that it worked.

{0.09->6.49}Those unthinkin' bugs never stood a chance against a genius tactical mind like yourself. {6.97->9.72}You are literally invincible! 
{0.00->1.41}This canister will see me through.
{0.00->0.31}4!
{0.02->0.63}I'm on it.
{0.00->0.53}Get in.
{0.00->1.38}Targets destroyed.
{0.02->0.86}Got a sample.
{0.00->3.89}Doesn't matter—we'll free 'em eventually, even if we have to kill every last one.
{0.00->2.86}E-710, the galaxy's greatest energy source.
{0.01->0.77}Illuminate.
{0.16->2.40}Hold a Stratagem Beacon. {4.36->7.83}Sleep with a Stratagem Beacon in your hand. {10.00->11.96}Let the Stratagem Beacon {12.86->14.75}become an extension of your body, like your hand or your gun.
{0.00->1.80}I wish I could kill 'em again.
{0.00->1.72}We need reinforcements!
{0.00->2.17}Kill them! Kill them all!
{0.00->1.50}Live to dive another day.
{0.01->1.18}Weapons ready!
{0.00->0.66}First one.
{0.09->0.77}Support weapon.
{0.00->2.34}Super Earth's finest!
{0.22->0.89}300 meters.
{0.00->2.95}You are a true champion of Democracy.
{0.00->0.45}I'm out!
{0.00->0.65}Gotta reload!
{0.08->1.95}What's the blast radius for these again?
{0.00->1.37}AHHHHH HA {2.28->3.03}HA HA!!
{0.00->2.52}High Priority Target is in your vicinity.
{0.00->0.64}Fall back.
{0.00->4.57}The DSS is so large, it's run by 10 Ship Masters.{5.00->5.95}Can you imagine?
{0.00->0.77}We made it!
{0.00->0.86}Let's do this!
{0.00->1.47}Visibility decreasing.
{0.00->1.30}I need supplies.
{0.03->1.45}It wants my brain!
{0.03->1.30}Liberty weeps. {1.75->4.78}And Democracy raises the sword of vengeance.
{0.00->2.27}A glorious operation, Helldiver. {2.78->6.07}It has been noted, logged...and rewarded.
{0.00->0.95}Enemy emplacement.
{0.01->1.05}Where to now?
{0.02->2.07}Get back, you filthy squids!
{0.00->0.54}Zero.
{0.00->2.61}Flag-forsaken leg's slowin' me down.
{0.00->0.89}I love you.
{0.00->1.02}Dangerous wildlife.
{0.03->1.47}I'll never forget this.
{0.00->0.95}Hold the line!
{0.01->1.01}Kill them all!
{0.05->0.63}Follow me.
{0.00->2.04}Bot Dropships incoming on your position!
{0.05->2.06}Filthy Terminid scum!
{0.00->1.63}Make every shot count!
{0.03->1.31}Reloading you!
{0.00->3.94}There is no one way to prove your devotion to Super Earth. {4.33->13.19}But there is one best way. Become a Helldiver. Become a hero. Become a legend.
{0.02->2.51}Get up! Please, get up!
{0.03->2.10}Shoot them! Shoot them!
{0.01->2.19}Live to Liberate another day!
{0.05->1.17}Squid outpost.
{0.00->0.41}Walker.
{0.00->3.21}Some of the crew like to talk about what they'll do when the war's over. {3.89->5.23}I don't allow that sort of thing—{5.68->7.24}we need to focus on the fight.
{0.00->0.84}Terminids
{0.03->1.57}The Achernar system
{0.01->1.11}Get us out of here!
{0.01->1.83}Democracy deliver us!
{0.02->1.66}My leg!
{0.00->1.16}We almost had to pull out. {1.89->2.84}I'm relieved we didn't.
{0.00->1.33}Marking extraction point.
{0.00->4.24}Go with haste. Pry their creeping tentacles from this world.
{0.00->0.48}Close.
{0.22->1.69}The Rirga Bay system
{0.00->2.11}Our requests have been answered!
{0.00->3.60}Remember soldiers: waste enemies, not bullets!
{0.02->0.77}Watch out!
{0.00->0.63}Ouch.
{0.00->1.14}Manning emplacement.
{0.03->2.43}Follow the cape, and everything's great.{2.97->4.94}Follow the cape, and everything's great.
{0.00->1.25}How bad is it?
{0.00->1.39}The Canopus system
{0.00->1.87}Terminid hive structure destroyed.
{0.00->2.66}We will carry their legacy!
{0.00->1.95}Very well. I'll do you proud.
{0.09->0.54}This...{1.05->3.04}isn't the end.
{0.00->0.49}That's good.
{0.00->0.87}Enemy emplacement.
{0.02->1.21}Rolling out!
{0.00->2.60}I'm sure you've wondered how voting works on a Destroyer. {3.08->5.26}Don't worry—our terminal is top-of-the-line. {5.68->7.34}Latest algorithm and everything.
{0.00->0.92}I need to reload.
{0.00->2.06}No fence can tell ME what to do.
{0.00->0.95}Fire in the hole.
{0.03->2.02}They're here! They're disgusting!
{0.19->1.37}You saved us!
{0.07->1.73}Listen to your heart, {2.66->4.77}the strength of its beat. {6.14->8.59}Is that the strength of one {8.59->9.00}person? No. It is the strength of all humanity. Organic, endoskeletal humanity.
{0.00->1.43}The Bunda system
{0.04->1.51}The Adhara system
{0.00->1.48}Welcome, Helldiver.{1.99->3.29}Glad to have you with us.
{0.01->3.28}FIRE IN THE HOLE! Die, Terrorists!
{0.01->1.91}Taste our Democracy!
{0.57->1.72}I wish I could do what you do.
{0.00->3.93}The final absolution of xenocide is a mellifluous clarion {4.34->5.50}guiding our path.
{0.03->3.00}Get back, you filthy squids!
{0.10->3.64}They didn't take responsibility, of course. Tried to blame it on "working conditions."
{0.00->1.40}Calling in mission shuttle.
{0.00->4.21}Dissidents sow their lies in the smallest of fractures, Helldiver. {4.80->6.05}Stay vigilant.
{0.03->1.49}The Asperoth system
{0.00->1.43}Not so high and mighty now, huh?
{0.00->1.22}Calling down supplies.
{0.00->0.68}Liberty!
{0.00->1.13}Deploying flare.
{0.03->3.75}You are the tinder, and Liberty is the match!
{0.03->1.69}Need. Stim.
{0.03->1.27}The Kerth system
{0.00->3.87}I realized long ago that death in the defense of Freedom {4.28->6.24}was not a tragedy to be lamented, {6.68->9.63}but a sacrifice to be revered.
{0.00->2.32}You really are incredible.
{0.02->0.64}Of course.
{0.01->2.88}Why a Helldiver? Whyyy?!
{0.00->1.28}Activating jump pack.
{0.01->1.22}Dirty squid.
{0.00->2.11}For a minute, I thought I might never vote again.
{0.00->2.31}Warning: you are in range of enemy artillery!
{0.00->1.30}The Parsh system
{0.00->0.53}Sentry.
{0.08->2.91}Skepticism is treason. Treason {3.51->4.48}is bad.

{0.00->0.54}No!
{0.00->0.58}Go now - {1.30->7.08}and fear the shadow of neither death nor tyranny, for Justice is your cause.

{0.27->1.07}300 meters.
{0.00->3.25}Now there's one less dissident, and I get one more doctor's visit every year.
{0.00->3.08}The Illuminate will wish they had remained in exile.
{0.00->3.01}You will never destroy our way of life.
{0.05->1.90}For Liberty's sake, shoot them!
{0.00->1.09}When's the shuttle coming?
{0.00->0.73}Terminids! {1.16->1.47}Run!
{0.05->3.95}I heard that some dissidents wanted us to select our own candidates instead of using the algorithm.
{0.00->4.15}This small bit of technology may lead to a large increase in Liberty.
{0.00->1.29}Calling down equipment.
{0.00->0.71}My leg. {1.47->3.18}Not functioning at capacity.
{0.02->0.72}There they are!
{0.00->1.40}The Martale system
{0.00->0.80}Steering clear.
{0.00->4.72}Element 710 is what allowed Super Earth to spread beyond our Solar System.{5.06->8.23}So just imagine where Element 711 could take us.
{0.00->1.34}The Gaellivare system
{0.00->2.15}Allied Destroyer leaving squadron.
{0.00->2.26}Can't Liberate with this broken arm.
{0.02->1.49}That must be why they have this on the ship.
{0.00->1.50}Almost time for another election. {2.10->2.79}I can't wait.
{0.00->0.62}Dropping item.
{0.05->1.25}Flag-forsaken leg's slowin' me down.
{0.00->0.46}Bravo
{0.00->1.22}Activating jump pack.
{0.01->2.11}High Command has answered our need!
{0.01->2.12}GET SOOOOOOME!
{0.10->0.88}Stimming you.
{0.00->2.07}Gotta find somewhere safe to wait this out.
{0.00->2.18}This operation is no longer viable. {2.59->4.49}We must redirect our attention.
{0.01->0.77}Be ready!
{0.00->4.96}Did you know? No one has ever truly rebelled against Super Earth. {5.37->11.82}Our top scientists have proven that all "rebels" were actually acting under Illuminate mind control.
{0.03->1.50}Get away from me, bot freak!
{0.21->1.30}Robot scum!
{0.01->0.59}No!
{0.00->0.64}Second one.
{0.03->2.18}For Liberty's sake, shoot them!
{0.00->2.14}Retribution will find you!
{0.04->1.30}Strength in numbers!
{0.00->2.48}But the navigation system's actually real simple:
{0.00->1.28}Stratagems selected.
{0.22->1.43}Focus on your breath. {3.36->4.91}Inhale Democracy, {6.60->8.64}exhale treasonous thoughts. {11.05->12.25}Inhale Liberty, exhale flesh-warping, brain-killing Illuminate mind control.
{0.00->0.84}On the double!
{0.04->1.43}Freedom save me!
{0.00->1.11}Deploying flare.
{0.00->0.87}Fire in the hole.
{0.00->0.67}Roger that.
{0.01->1.24}How'd they even get here?
{0.00->8.25}The Super Destroyer is fully upgraded...this is the happiest day of my entire life.
{0.00->2.90}We may be outnumbered, but we'll never be outgunned.
{0.00->2.59}Another sample collected for Democracy.
{0.00->0.73}Out of ammo.
{0.03->2.63}Get back! Get back!
{0.00->2.95}Back when I was a kid, we used to play "Bug Killers" out in the schoolyard.
{0.00->0.93}New canister.
{0.01->6.11}Is that... me? Oh! I'm...I'm honored!
{0.00->0.52}Bugs.
{0.00->0.85}Injury? What {1.27->1.95}injury!
{0.00->1.70}Liberty guides my hand.
{0.01->0.38}Whups!
{0.00->1.08}Welcome, Helldiver. {1.50->3.89}Operation Valiant Enclosure has begun. {4.47->8.53}With your aid, we shall drive the Terminids back into their Galactic pen.
{0.00->2.15}Things they were sayin', where they were headed, that sort of stuff. 
{0.00->0.95}Primary objective.
{0.00->1.56}I'll reload you!
{0.00->0.53}No!
{0.00->9.58}A reading from the Citizens' Oath, passage 8:28: We trust that in all things,{10.00->13.79}the Government works for the those who work for it.
{0.00->1.76}Liberty guide my legs!
{0.00->1.36}The Arlia system
{0.00->1.10}They're still coming!
{0.00->3.86}We cannot mourn this loss while the city remains imperiled.
{0.01->2.29}FREEDOM CONQUERS ALL!
{0.02->1.49}The tentacles!
{0.01->1.78}Feels gooooood.
{0.00->2.24}The Helldivers'll stop 'em—I know it.
{0.00->2.54}Mission accomplished without a single casualty. {3.27->5.73}It's a good day for Managed Democracy.
{0.00->3.25}Whoa! Not every day you get to see a Hellbomb.
{0.03->1.57}This is where the shuttle lands?
{0.02->1.76}The Halies Port system
{0.18->3.98}The engineers filled the TCS tanks with enough Termicide to last over a year. {4.46->7.54}Should be easy enough to replenish, once all the Terminids are dead.
{0.02->1.02}Oh no, bots!
{0.02->1.56}Squids! Run!
{0.00->4.75}You know, sometimes as a technician, you gotta realize when something's beyond repair.
{0.00->1.28}Marking extraction point.
{0.01->0.93}They're dead!
{0.00->1.52}I live to serve!
{0.02->1.63}Liberty watch over us!
{0.01->2.86}Hero down!
{0.00->3.31}So, uh, are we getting evacuated, or, uh...?
{0.01->3.14}If this is a trap, it's our Democratic duty to be the bait.
{0.02->0.86}More Illuminate!
{0.02->1.05}Open fire!
{0.00->0.93}Joining the fray.
{0.02->1.03}Somebody help!
{0.12->2.27}We can't lose another planet, not now.
{0.00->0.65}Helldiver - {1.10->6.47}successful missions are rewarded by Super Earth High Command. These resources can be used to make {6.47->8.49}your Destroyer even more powerful.
{0.00->1.74}Biological sample secured.
{0.00->1.86}This lady gotta get 'erself one of those.
{0.00->0.54}Of course.
{0.03->1.74}Help me, please!
{0.00->1.48}The Meridian system
{0.00->2.09}There, good as new! {2.09->3.92}Now, look sharp. {3.92->7.83}You're about to encounter Democracy's sworn enemy, recruit.
{0.00->0.22}This {0.94->1.15}is the right place. Right?
{0.00->1.72}That should boost crew morale.
{0.00->0.91}Bot fabricator.
{0.00->1.55}Freedom requires firepower.
{0.00->2.53}Now that is good solid Super Earth product.
{0.51->2.99}The Automatons gather human bodies. {3.67->7.81}What twisted algorithm is behind these posthumous abductions?
{0.00->1.06}Requesting equipment!
{0.00->1.02}Excellent work.{1.47->4.74}If I didn't know you'd never received urban warfare training,{5.33->6.76}I'd never have guessed.
{0.03->1.74}Somebody get a stim!
{0.00->0.63}ETA T-{1.03->2.91}10 seconds. Clear landing zone.
{0.02->1.15}More Automatons!

{0.01->1.48}Over there! Over there!
{0.02->1.33}Keep your focus!
{0.00->0.70}We're safe!
{0.00->2.94}Plant the flag in front of that statue, recruit! 
{0.14->2.26}Sweet mother of Freedom!{3.82->6.19}Is there a finer sight than a Hellbomb?
{0.00->1.43}Run away!
{0.06->0.78}Helldiver. {1.28->2.99}The Illuminate have returned. {3.42->7.24}They are an ancient enemy—one we had believed was annihilated.
{0.00->2.63}We leave a city in ruins.
{0.03->1.84}Get away from me, bot freak!
{0.00->1.79}Thank you for helping us, Helldiver.
{0.00->1.68}Our enemy advances. {2.13->5.81}They will pay for every inch with a gallon of blood.
{0.00->2.74}History will remember your deeds this day.
{0.02->0.84}No!
{0.00->1.45}Performing assisted reload.
{0.00->1.33}I fight for Super Earth.
{0.00->0.78}We're saved.

{0.76->3.78}I can almost taste the Freedom from here!
{0.03->1.69}Stay dead, scum.
{0.06->1.32}The Errant system
{0.01->2.81}Agh! Uh -- FIRE IN THE HOLE!

{0.00->4.50}0 friendly fire incidents is the sort of statistical anomaly I welcome.
{0.01->1.47}Oop! GRENADE!
{0.00->1.86}Thank you for saving us.
{0.02->1.25}Gotta reload!
{0.00->1.42}The Obari system
{0.06->1.51}The Acubens system
{0.02->0.89}Get down!
{0.05->2.32}Should we be farther away?
{0.00->1.29}Lookin' forward to our next chat.
{0.00->1.42}Let's rest here.
{0.00->1.72}Xenophobic scum.
{0.00->1.36}The Pollux system
{0.00->2.01}Many sacrifices were made today. {2.93->5.05}We will never forget.
{0.02->0.99}Down here!
{0.00->0.63}I've got you.
{0.00->2.13}You really are the best of the best.
{0.00->2.70}They did their part. Now it's our turn.
{0.02->1.71}Get away from me, bug freak!
{0.00->0.92}Out of ammo.
{0.01->4.75}Gas! It's gas!
{0.01->1.79}The Helldivers will save us.

{0.01->4.19}YEAH! SHOOT THEIR HEADS OFF! LEAVE NOTHING BEHIND!
{0.00->0.38}Delta
{0.02->1.49}I'll be fine...
{0.07->1.14}Additional objective.
{0.03->0.85}The enemy!
{0.04->3.04}When I face Super Earth for the Vow of Allegiance every morning,{3.04->5.05}I can almost always feel where it is. {5.50->7.35}Even in a brand-new part of the galaxy.
{0.00->4.66}The Illuminate want to control us. To stay Free, you MUST destroy them.
{0.00->1.95}High-value sample collected.
{0.01->4.09}Crushed under the heel of Justice. As they should be.
{0.00->5.30}Reminder: the Democracy Officer's personal sauna is off limits to crew.
{0.01->2.54}Feed the flames of Justice!
{0.00->1.95}I bet the dissidents have something to do with this.
{0.01->2.91}They don't have object permanence! Hide!
{0.00->2.12}I repeat: reinforcement ready.
{0.12->3.89}That's right, squids. Go back to whatever slimehole you crawled out of.
{0.00->2.22}Enemy tactical asset within threat range.
{0.00->0.88}Keep moving.
{0.01->1.21}Super Earth{1.67->3.19}protect us...
{0.00->3.18}I could watch Helldivers work all day long.
{0.00->4.83}One day, the Stranger asked Danny if he wanted to know one last secret—{5.24->6.95}the biggest secret of them all. 
{0.00->2.63}The bugs will feel the effects of that operation.
{0.03->3.86}The enemy has taken a planet closer to Super Earth than this one. {4.58->7.39}You are now deep behind enemy lines, Helldiver.
{1.38->3.80}Nothing a Helldiver can't take...
{0.00->1.47}Calling down a walker.
{0.01->1.66}Time to make history.
{0.00->1.28}Calling down a walker.
{0.02->1.47}More Red-eyes!
{0.00->4.42}Thousands of freedom-loving citizens were killed in the mines of Cyberstan. {4.93->6.86}Don't let their deaths be in vain. {7.28->8.95}Buy war bonds today!
{0.00->3.24}Cannot. Liberate. Effectively. With injured arm.
{0.00->3.46}This operation would hamstring the enemy's capabilities.
{0.00->2.30}Every star is a distress beacon, {2.81->4.79}crying out for Liberation.
{0.00->0.71}Fourth one.

{0.05->2.67}Real Helldivers! I don't believe it!
{0.02->3.07}They got me. Need a second!
{0.00->1.28}The Maw system
{0.01->1.43}When's the shuttle coming?
{0.00->0.71}Rolling out.
{0.00->2.95}I just set all the ship's clocks back an hour for Freedom Savings Time.
{0.00->1.64}Gave those robots a taste of Freedom.
{0.00->2.70}Mourn later. Cover their zones!
{0.00->3.39}That was the coolest moment of my entire life.

{0.00->4.40}The Bugs held onto their homeworld for now, but it's only a matter of time before we squash 'em for {4.40->4.80}good.
{0.00->3.18}The tides of Liberty will sweep these streets clean.
{0.00->0.70}ETA T-{1.18->2.11}2 minutes.
{0.00->1.38}Extraction is available.
{0.00->7.47}Man down! Don't sweat it, soldier: friendly fire is just an unavoidable fact of life. Nothin' AT {7.47->13.75}ALL you can do to prevent it! What you CAN do is use the Reinforcement Stratagem to replace your {13.75->14.76}fallen comrade!
{0.00->0.85}Last reload.
{0.00->1.52}The bridge is yours, Helldiver. {2.08->3.08}Take us to the fight.

{0.05->1.44}Finally the Gloom,{1.85->8.25}that sporous miasma, will be dispersed by the great wind turbines of Liberty.
{0.00->4.70}This ship will never visit most of our planets. Why? Because they aren't under attack. {5.22->6.14}And with you here, {6.58->7.72}they'll stay that way.
{0.02->0.81}Kill them all!
{0.00->3.67}One small scrap of technology, one giant leap for Liberty.
{0.09->1.95}Are you sure it's safe here?
{0.01->2.13}Again! Hit 'em again!

{0.00->0.10}I don't think I can do that.

{0.00->0.89}I need to reload.
{0.15->6.41}The bot War Strider is a crude imitation of our far superior Exosuit technology. {6.97->13.84}The Automatons' attempts at dominance only serve to lay bare their fundamental inferiority.

{0.00->2.18}A few more bots out of commission.
{0.00->2.18}This must be part of Super Earth's plan.
{0.00->1.30}Yeah, let's finish this.
{0.03->1.34}Look out! Squids!
{0.00->0.41}Close.
{0.01->3.76}Super Earth protect us...
{0.00->2.11}That's what happens when you mess with Super Earth!
{0.06->2.65}BATHE IN THE BLOOD OF TYRANTS!!!
{0.00->2.87}Now we're part of Super Earth's victory.
{0.00->0.85}How could they win?...{1.69->3.34}We must've been betrayed.

{0.00->1.50}Are you sure it's safe here?
{0.00->7.41}Did you know? The scientific term for a group of bugs is  "A Bane of Terminids." The unofficial {7.41->9.14}term is "Future Element {9.53->9.95}710."

{0.38->3.40}And now, another helpful tip from General Brasch.{5.91->8.31}You will get shot at. {10.98->14.91}But remember your ABCs and you will never die. {15.20->18.34}Always. Be. Taking Cover. {19.74->22.05}Because if there's one thing I've learned,{22.26->25.64}it's that bullets do not go through cover. {26.28->30.05}Assuming that cover is thick and largely impenetrable. {31.49->35.35}BRASCH TACTICS!

{0.01->1.59}Fellow citizens!
{0.00->1.62}I always vote early so I don't forget.
{0.07->3.39}And now, another helpful tip from General Brasch.{7.31->11.63}If the enemy can see you, the enemy can kill you.{12.87->16.07}So get out of sight and lose your pursuers!{16.31->21.31}Because if there's one thing I've learned, it's that you gotta hide to survive. {21.98->23.46}But not for too long! {23.71->24.59}Because that...{25.09->26.76}makes you a coward. {30.40->34.16}BRASCH TACTICS! Use 'em, or die trying.
{0.00->3.37}Why a Helldiver? Whyyy?!

{0.01->2.23}They got me. Need a second!
{0.01->1.60}Democracy binds us!
{0.01->0.83}Thank you.
{0.00->1.09}Out of ammo!
{0.00->0.78}They're dead!
{0.00->2.92}Back when I was a kid, we'd play Bots and Helldivers every Summer.
{0.13->2.26}Heh, who's next?
{0.03->1.21}To the skies.
{0.00->1.97}Can't forget to check up on shuttle maintenance.
{0.00->2.30}Honor their sacrifice. Fight on!
{0.00->1.33}Maintain your resolve!
{0.04->5.27}If Terminids didn't decompose into Element 710, we'd have eradicated them completely a long time {5.27->5.61}ago. {7.05->7.25}They should count themselves lucky.
{1.18->1.55}Help! Help!
{0.00->2.16}Freedom requires firepower.
{0.00->0.44}You know, {0.81->4.85}the cost of one stratagem is more than most citizens make in a year. {5.41->7.80}You can see why they only entrust them to Helldivers.
{0.02->1.89}Kill them! Kill them!
{0.00->0.71}Tie.
{0.00->1.51}Establish a perimeter.
{0.00->1.48}The Choepessa system
{0.03->5.91}Maybe we don't even need the TCS. You Helldivers seem to kill plenty of bugs just fine on your own.
{0.13->2.97}It's gotta be real satisfyin', hearin' 'em crunch under your boot.
{0.00->0.95}That was a close one.
{0.05->1.32}What is that?
{0.03->1.91}Get away from me, bug freak!
{0.02->2.24}Helldiver! Nooooooooooo!
{0.00->1.90}I hope it hurt.
{0.06->0.86}5!
{0.00->3.73}Here at war, you may cast your vote many times. {4.19->5.69}Once on Election Day, {6.10->10.31}and another with every bullet buried in an enemy combatant.
{0.02->3.13}FIRE IN THE HOLE! Die, Terrorists!
{0.00->1.29}Calling down a walker.
{0.00->0.55}Reloading.
{0.00->1.20}Help me!
{0.01->2.44}Yes! Push forward!
{0.01->3.25}Make way for Super Earth's finest!
{0.00->2.74}I give every crew member a half day off on Liberty Day. {3.45->5.69}Some things are sacred, even on the front.
{0.01->0.99}Watch yourself!
{0.17->4.30}It's like they're trying to turn the whole galaxy into one big socialist murder factory.
{0.02->8.36}Alert: Liberation of currently orbited planet from Illuminate menace has ended in absolute victory. {8.60->11.53}Planet now under Super Earth control.
{0.00->3.45}Whatever you find down in that Flag-forsaken murk,{3.86->5.02}exterminate it.
{0.00->3.66}You put 'em on the bottom of your boot, and it was like you were squashin' bugs every time you took {3.66->3.95}a step. 
{0.00->0.60}Got one.
{0.01->2.95}Say hello to Democracy.
{0.00->2.64}Alcubierre drive calibration complete.
{0.00->3.22}Uh, Democracy for everybody!
{0.00->1.51}Calling in extraction!
{0.02->0.90}Duck and cover!
{0.96->5.60}Again, please do not use orbital strikes in ways that cause excessive damage {5.79->7.24}to the training facility.
{0.00->4.15}The Helldivers have liberated this planet in the name of Democracy. {4.61->5.94}There is no more to be done here; {6.43->7.83}extraction awaits.
{0.00->3.41}The Illuminate Cult will pay for their transgressions.
{0.00->0.85}Move it!
{0.00->3.45}This bio sample will directly increase our Freedom.
{0.00->3.67}Operation accomplished. Your valor is beyond question.
{0.01->1.39}This isn't over.
{1.50->2.95}This evens the odds.
{0.01->2.87}The squids are gonna eat our brains!
{0.00->0.70}We're safe!
{0.01->1.14}Danger close!
{0.00->4.92}Our forces fight to free this planet from the mechanical grip of the Automatons. {5.50->9.40}A litany of elite operations await your initiation.
{0.01->2.01}Peacekeeping at its finest!
{0.26->1.07}I love you...{1.70->2.82}Super Earth...
{0.00->1.52}Administering Freedom.
{0.00->1.52}Eagle, back from the nest.
{0.00->2.43}Extraction complete. Pelican 1 beginning ascent.
{0.00->1.07}How much longer?
{0.01->0.95}Eat this!
{0.02->1.94}Tear 'em apart, Helldiver!
{0.00->2.60}Liberty's enemies march ever closer.
{0.06->0.50}Hail!
{0.03->1.04}You saved us!
{0.00->1.50}Requesting fortifications.
{0.00->3.34}A planet cries out for succor. We must help.
{0.02->2.79}Go back where you belong, filthy aliens!
{0.00->1.32}Tac-pack inbound.
{0.03->0.60}Bugs!
{0.01->1.95}Swapping Internal Cooling Element.
{0.00->5.92}Criticism of Super Earth's ideals are a telltale sign of Illuminate mind control. {6.42->11.26}Help critics by turning them over to your local Science Officer for reeducation.
{0.00->2.73}Recruit expired. Request Hellpod sanitation crew.
{0.03->1.37}Shoot them! Shoot them!
{0.07->2.23}Close your eyes.{2.23->10.37}See yourself standing before a great nebula of Terminid spores.{10.37->18.13}Clench your fist. Send your fist into that tyrannical cloud.{18.13->25.76}Hear the enemy scream. Watch as they suffer. You are whole.
{0.00->1.36}Establish security.
{0.00->2.38}They will sing ballads of your deeds.
{0.00->2.19}Freedom requires firepower.
{0.00->2.93}Your fellow Helldivers rage against the enemy's tyranny. {3.74->4.37}Join them.
{0.00->2.14}You have served Democracy well. {2.52->3.87}Extraction awaits.
{0.00->0.45}No!
{0.00->3.22}Recruit expired. Send in human remains disposal team.
{0.09->2.95}Finally, no more children getting eaten alive in their beds.
{0.01->2.88}Should've stayed at home, Squid!
{0.00->0.75}Second one.
{0.00->3.58}Well done down there. The Gloom will be gone in no time.
{0.00->2.70}Super Earth will reap what you sow.
{0.00->0.95}We got your back!
{0.03->1.51}I'll remember this forever.
{0.00->2.36}This bio sample will directly increase our Freedom.
{0.00->1.43}Requesting equipment!
{0.00->0.73}ETA T-{1.31->2.64}1 minute and 30 seconds.
{0.00->1.28}Brainless bot.
{0.00->0.56}I'm on it.
{0.00->0.83}Reloading.
{0.00->2.53}Our planetary defense has failed. {3.04->6.88}Now we must prevent the enemy's further encroachment upon this world.
{0.04->5.41}Within the dead bugs you leave behind, lie the secrets of their brethren's annihilation.
{0.00->0.94}I need supplies.
{0.09->4.70}The Voteless would have been subjected to endless anti-Democratic propaganda. {5.19->10.76}The resulting mental distress likely led to the total destruction of their minds.
{0.01->0.78}Let's go!
{0.00->0.84}Dropping item!
{0.01->2.63}No-one takes MY Freedom!
{0.00->0.65}Aerial enemy.
{0.01->0.61}Affirmative.
{0.00->0.57}No!
{0.34->2.09}They escaped the farms.{2.72->5.93}They murdered good citizens of Super Earth.{6.56->9.17}Now, they're coming for you.{10.06->12.06}The only thing that can stop them? {14.90->16.97}A strong economy!{18.63->20.81}Don't let your family get murdered—{21.23->23.20}spend your extra cash today!
{0.00->4.16}There is but one sentence commensurate to the crime of treason.
{0.00->0.82}You're here!
{0.00->0.70}Third one.
{0.00->1.03}As you command.
{0.02->3.33}Go back where you belong, filthy aliens!
{0.00->1.29}The Shallus system
{0.00->1.60}Have a taste of Democracy!
{0.00->1.35}For Liberty's sake, shoot them!
{0.08->5.09}The Gloom has altered the very air of the worlds caught in its haze. {5.67->13.09}Once-familiar worlds are now foreign lands, nesting grounds for skittering new monstrosities.
{0.00->3.98}I don't know how you do it, Helldiver. Facing off against monsters who haven't got a democratic {3.98->4.86}bone in their body.
{0.01->1.69}They got what they deserved.
{0.00->2.79}The people of Super Earth look to us for hope. {3.40->4.55}And we will deliver it—{4.98->7.66}one enemy corpse at a time.
{0.00->1.90}That's what you deserve!
{0.00->1.89}Crystallized E-710 acquired.
{0.55->1.67}Dirty squid.
{0.01->1.31}We gotta get out of here!
{0.00->3.76}Choose an operation, and free this world from tyranny.
{0.00->1.52}Super Uranium acquired.
{0.00->0.54}Nevermind.
{0.00->0.95}I need to reload.
{0.28->2.32}Ahem. As a... uh, {2.81->4.11}supplementary note, {4.60->9.42}try firing in short, controlled bursts to improve your accuracy. {9.94->10.61}Uh, thank you.
{0.05->2.95}Super Earth must be trying to give 'em a false sense of security.
{0.04->3.85}We gotta get the Helldivers back down there, before they build more death factories.
{0.00->0.05}I got the terminal.
{0.00->0.84}Tactical benefit.
{0.00->0.53}That one.
{0.03->1.50}Augh, get it off!
{0.00->1.20}That's for the Creek.
{0.00->3.54}SWEET MOTHER OF FREEDOM! DID YOU SEE THAT?!
{0.00->0.60}Helldiver. {1.01->2.20}We're counting on you.
{0.02->1.81}Kill them! Kill them all!
{0.00->2.66}Liberty smiles upon your triumph.
{0.01->2.18}You're here to save us, I know it!
{0.00->2.37}Our enemies can fight as hard as they like, {2.79->3.45}but Freedom {3.99->4.95}always wins.
{0.02->1.42}Rare sample acquired.
{0.00->0.62}YES!{0.99->1.38}I mean,{1.91->2.44}roger that.
{0.00->3.64}Soon as those Flag-forsakin' freaks are in range...
{0.01->1.09}Might be safer here!
{0.00->1.11}If they even have bones.
{0.66->2.39}And STAY offline!
{0.00->1.48}Calling down a sentry.
{0.00->1.33}The Merak system
{0.00->4.19}Once we make it out of this, I'm gonna donate the rest of my salary to the war effort.
{0.00->0.84}My arm!
{0.02->1.01}The bugs are back!
{0.00->2.62}We near operational completion.
{0.00->1.78}This'll all blow over soon enough.
{0.01->0.98}Tactical impediment.
{0.00->2.89}Our achievements do not go unrecognized.
{0.00->0.93}This is for you!
{0.00->1.25}Calling down a vehicle.
{0.00->3.01}Fallen foes -- Freedom's fuel.
{0.01->1.08}Is that all they got!?
{0.00->0.70}Freedom five!
{0.00->2.93}Our enemies strike deeper towards Liberty's heart. {3.39->5.32}We must stop them.
{0.00->1.61}Are you sure it's safe here?
{0.00->1.73}We knew you'd save us.
{0.00->7.14}We shall fight in the streets. We shall fight on the sidewalks. We shall fight in the intersections!
{0.00->1.31}Eagle 1, armed and ready.
{0.00->3.95}Everyone was collectin' 'em, tryin' to get the rare ones. Man, those things were cool.
{0.00->2.69}The Illuminate terrorists reap what they sow.
{0.00->1.22}Objective complete.
{0.10->1.52}They might take our lives,{1.93->4.57}but they'll never take our values.
{0.00->1.37}I'll handle the terminal.
{0.00->0.39}Seven.
{0.00->1.07}I've got the package.
{0.04->1.40}The Achird system
{0.05->1.45}Make it stop!
{0.07->3.27}And now, another helpful tip from General Brasch.{5.98->13.50}Ah, the simple joy of unloading round after round into the bodies of your enemies. {13.64->16.18}Oh, yeah. That's good...{16.68->19.10}But if you get carried away...{19.97->22.17}your shootin' days are over! {25.17->30.00}Elite soldiers adjust their fire mode, so they can keep the killin'{30.03->31.75}goin' all day long. {34.52->35.58}Oh yeah,{36.39->38.03}that's good. {39.99->43.81}BRASCH TACTICS! Use 'em, or die trying.
{0.00->1.01}Let's move!
{0.00->0.42}South.
{0.00->0.36}One.
{0.00->2.06}Their lives were in our hands.
{0.00->3.17}I like it, cuz you can always visualize where you'd be standing on Super Earth if you went straight {3.17->3.36}there.
{0.00->4.77}Danny listened to every word, and he got to meet more strangers, and listened to their secrets, too.
{0.00->5.51}The Ministry of Expansion Exploitation Committee will carry on their legacy.
{0.03->0.86}Steering clear.
{0.01->0.62}Get in!
{9.03->11.00}Super Earth. {11.00->12.65}Our home. {13.17->14.84}Prosperity. {15.78->17.30}Liberty. {19.66->21.94}Democracy. {21.94->24.20}Our way of life. {28.46->31.39}But freedom doesn't come free. {32.27->33.08}No… {33.20->34.76}sweet Liberty… {35.11->36.41}NOOOO! {38.43->41.49}(laughs) Look familiar? {41.93->46.28}Scenes like these are happening all over the galaxy, right now! {46.28->49.18}You could be next. {49.18->54.27}That is unless you make the most important decision of your life. {55.29->61.66}Prove to yourself that you have the strength and the courage to be free.{61.66->65.42} Join... the Helldivers. {65.42->68.63}Become part of an elite peacekeeping force!  {72.90->75.51}See exotic new lifeforms.{79.54->84.26}And spread Managed Democracy throughout the galaxy.{84.80->87.06}Become a HERO.  {87.79->89.96}Become a LEGEND.{90.81->94.44}Become a Helldiver!
{0.00->2.15}Countdown initiated. Stand by for takeoff.
{0.00->1.34}They're coming!
{0.00->2.74}Don't worry—the Helldivers are protecting us!
{0.03->1.32}They're coming soon, right?
{0.00->5.30}Gas! It's gas!
{0.01->1.80}Freedom save me!
{0.00->1.94}Rest in pain, dirtbag.
{0.00->2.15}Enemy tactical asset within range.
{0.66->1.86}Son of a dissident!
{0.01->0.89}I'm empty!
{0.10->1.42}Stinking Fascist.
{0.05->2.08}This is Pelican 1, preparing for touchdown. 
{0.00->2.01}I knew the Helldivers would protect us.
{0.02->1.00}Gotta reload!
{0.00->0.57}Fall back!
{0.00->1.53}The Irulta system
{0.04->1.50}More Automatons!
{0.00->1.83}Biological sample secured.
{0.05->0.68}Out of ammo.
{0.00->2.46}Let the light of Liberty shine!
{0.02->1.73}Freedom never rests!
{0.35->4.47}The Automatons seek to convert this world into another factory of tyranny. {4.88->6.59}You must stop them.
{0.02->1.10}The tentacles!
{0.00->5.45}Don't worry. Top Super Earth scientists have proven that bugs don't feel pain.
{0.02->0.98}Get down!
{0.00->1.64}This will all be over soon.
{0.00->0.74}Not engaging.
{0.02->0.76}Reloading.
{0.02->4.84}The enemy has retained its hold upon this world. But we will fight on.
{0.00->3.09}The Democracy Officer is here to optimize our Citizenship. {3.76->4.31}We're lucky—{4.82->7.95}we should always strive to be the best Citizens we can be.
{0.00->1.44}Reporting to the front.
{0.00->7.77}Alert: Defense of currently orbited planet from Automaton invasion has ended in absolute victory. {8.17->11.19}Planet remains under Super Earth control.
{0.04->0.89}We've got equipment.
{0.00->1.60}Liberty guides my hand.
{0.00->6.07}Another triumph for Managed Democracy. May Liberty guide your safe extraction.
{0.03->1.11}Somebody help!
{0.00->2.70}Maybe this time we'll finally find their weapons of mass destruction.
{0.00->1.44}Calling down support weapon.
{0.00->2.05}I hear we're finally liberating the Bot Homeworld.
{0.00->1.06}Requesting tac-pack.
{0.00->4.30}Can't wait to watch us drive those xenophobic monsters back to whatever slimehole they crawled out {4.30->4.57}of.
{0.00->1.65}As Democracy decrees.
{0.00->1.32}Welcome back, Helldivers. {1.93->7.10}Your comrades who didn't return will rest easy knowing that this mission had a lower than average {7.10->7.89}casualty rate.
{0.04->2.10}Kill it! Destroy it!
{0.02->1.73}I'll never forget this.
{0.49->0.65}Tac-pack's empty.
{0.00->0.52}Don't need it.
{0.00->0.83}Leave me...{1.32->3.11}save Super Earth...
{0.00->1.20}Legendarium acquired.
{0.00->1.48}The Pathfinder system
{0.00->2.80}It's fun, but my bugs keep breaking free, again and again. {3.21->4.21}Dunno what I'm doin' wrong.
{0.01->1.61}They can't keep this up, right?
{0.00->1.11}Nothing in the chamber.
{0.00->0.94}Sweet Liberty!
{0.00->0.40}Four.
{0.01->1.43}Requesting fortifications.
{0.00->0.47}Bravo
{0.02->1.35}My leg!
{0.05->1.63}What are they?
{0.03->1.75}R-reloading!
{0.00->1.53}The Primordia system
{0.01->3.46}Helldiver down! Death to the enemy!
{0.00->0.78}100 meters.
{0.00->0.57}South.
{0.00->3.43}Sweet Liberty! They got a Helldiver!
{0.00->0.62}Alright then.
{0.00->1.94}Its an honor, Helldiver.
{0.00->3.78}Every sector in the galaxy must be purged of the alien menace.
{0.00->0.95}I need stims.
{0.00->1.74}Automatons!
{0.03->1.48}A failed operation. {2.03->3.95}We will rise from its ashes.
{0.00->0.61}I've got you.
{0.02->0.52}Run!
{0.00->1.24}That was a close one!
{0.00->1.39}A worthy choice.
{0.00->1.31}The Euphoria system
{0.00->0.76}Critical item.
{0.00->1.21}Gotta be another way...?
{0.00->0.73}I win.
{0.00->0.99}You'll pay for that,{1.06->2.21}alien scum!
{0.01->0.72}Moving out!
{0.44->1.04}Terminids!
{0.03->3.54}This is Coretta Kelly with All you Need to Know.{3.54->7.81}Intel indicates the Terminid terrorists that struck New Hope{7.81->11.24}City are highly likely to be based in the Gloom.{11.38->17.55}Citizens  are sharing tips for "de-Tyrannizing" their space following enemy invasion.{17.55->23.15}And: the ongoing "housing shortage" has been downgraded to a "temporary housing{23.15->29.10}inconvenience." Documentation using outdated terminology should be promptly burned.{29.11->31.49}And that, is All You Need to Know.
{0.00->0.57}Fall back.
{0.01->1.49}Stratagems selected.
{0.00->3.80}Justice is putting an end to those who would destroy us. {4.25->10.19}Justice is every citizen having an equal chance to excel within their assigned role. {10.61->13.48}Justice is Super Earth.
{0.04->1.53}The bots found us!
{0.01->3.17}When I vote, I'll think of you, Helldiver.
{0.00->1.35}Look out! Squids!
{0.01->2.07}Son of a dissident!
{0.01->0.88}Reloading!
{0.01->2.99}Adversity is the true test of Citizenship!
{0.00->0.75}Gotta swap I.C.E.
{0.02->1.99}Kill them! Kill them all!
{0.00->0.67}Fire in the hole.
{0.00->1.54}The Tien Kwan system
{0.00->1.43}The more the mightier.
{0.00->1.95}Nothing can topple our way of life!
{0.02->1.03}Get it away from me!
{0.00->2.67}Those socialist murder-bots just won't die!
{0.00->0.85}Enemy emplacement.
{0.08->1.32}The Zzaniah system
{0.00->3.03}Protecting Freedom isn't just the right thing to do; {3.66->4.73}it's the law.
{0.00->4.75}Helldivers are heroes. Helldivers are Liberty.
{0.00->1.45}No pain no Freedom.
{0.00->0.94}Eager to obey!
{0.02->1.04}Get it off of me!
{0.05->3.36}Terminids exhibiting swarm intelligence shouldn't come as a surprise.{3.75->8.14}Even regular Super Earth ants can solve some group puzzles faster than scientists.{8.71->12.86}Well, they used to be able to. Those ants have all been exterminated.
{0.02->1.27}Requesting orbital strike!
{0.00->1.29}As you command.
{0.00->2.38}Right away. A genius idea.
{0.00->2.91}You leave a more free city than you found.
{0.00->4.41}Someday, we'll have killed every last bug, Automaton, and Illuminate, and the galaxy will finally {4.41->4.95}be at peace.
{0.07->1.95}Super Earth's Finest!
{0.02->1.20}Eat this!
{0.04->2.66}Get away from me, bot freak!

{12.11->13.09}Good afternoon. {13.09->22.33}Today, millions of citizens across the galaxy attended processions in memoriam for those lost in the Moradesh Dark Fluid Incident.{22.33->33.10}As most viewers are likely aware, the planet of Moradesh was collapsed into a singularity following a disastrous meltdown at the Dark Fluid Research Facility.{33.10->44.18}First responders continue to search for survivors, but due to the effects of time dilation, any escapees are unlikely to be found for at least 100 years.{44.18->47.54}While investigators look into the cause of the incident,{47.54->53.39}Helldivers continue to defend against the Terminid onslaught from the Meridian Supercolony,{53.39->56.61}after efforts to destroy it failed last week.{56.61->62.00}Meanwhile, scientists are working to develop a new and improved Termicide formula,{62.00->67.18}giving hope for relief as the Automatons also continue to advance.{67.18->69.05}That's Liberty's Latest; I'm Coretta Kelly.

{0.00->1.35}The Polaris system
{0.05->12.53}Relax. Float, as if in a hydropod. Now, envision a squid, swimming toward you.{12.53->26.76}Reaching out its tentacles. Now take out your blade, and lop off every single, slimy arm.{26.76->28.81}You are safe.
{0.02->0.50}Three.
{0.03->0.82}Look out!
{0.00->3.97}When the undemocratic din of our enemies has at last been silenced, {4.38->10.93}we shall finally perceive the unsullied peal of Democracy, reverberating evermore.
{0.00->0.81}Nevermind.
{0.00->1.57}The Liberty Ridge system
{0.01->1.69}I'm out! Cover me!!!
{0.00->2.61}One day I'm gonna figure out exactly what these're for.

{0.03->1.66}GET SOOOOOOME!
{0.00->1.44}Are you sure it's safe here?
{0.00->2.95}Death and destruction is all they're programmed for.
{0.00->3.80}A Helldiver! A real Helldiver!

{0.02->1.59}Get it off of me!
{0.00->3.43}Enemy High Priority Target should be nearby. Stay sharp.
{0.05->3.26}This is Coretta Kelly with All you Need to Know.{3.26->9.10}The Illuminate have been observed conducting reconnaissance of formerly-occupied planets.{9.10->12.76}Theories of Terminid ""swarm intelligence"" are in doubt,{12.76->16.74}as Helldivers report outsmarting the bugs on a daily basis.{16.74->19.75}And: Dissident arrests rose again this quarter,{19.75->24.93}further evidence supporting the highly successful pre-Dissidence identification program.{25.12->27.78}And that, is All You Need to Know.

{0.04->0.82}Welcome back. {1.23->3.67}The Illuminate might be an advanced species, but {4.09->5.74}they're no match for the Helldivers.
{0.00->1.10}I'll handle the terminal.
{0.00->0.47}New mag.
{0.00->0.49}Will do!
{0.00->2.72}Soon as those Flag-forsakin' freaks are in range...
{0.00->2.08}Our heroes will be remembered. {2.53->4.95}And their failure will be redressed.
{0.00->1.26}Legendarium acquired.
{0.00->2.64}That's one less terrorist to worry about.
{0.00->2.31}Sure do love that I get to watch this all day.
{0.00->1.89}Liberty. Prosperity. {2.25->3.24}Democracy.
{0.01->2.95}Hostiles! Lock and load, soldiers!
{0.00->1.60}They died as they fought --{1.97->2.67}a hero.

{0.05->2.27}Taste Justice, robot scum!
{0.00->2.08}Civic duty at its finest.
{0.17->1.38}We knew you'd save us.
{0.15->2.45}Super Earth will...{2.86->3.73}avenge me...
{0.00->0.73}Well done.
{0.00->0.71}On my way.
{0.12->1.53}Steady yourselves!

{0.00->0.43}Mag.
{0.11->2.25}Nothing can dodge Democracy.
{0.03->1.63}This will all be over soon.
{0.01->0.73}New mag.
{0.00->0.80}Right away!
"{4.02->7.73}Freedom's Greetings, I'm your host, Coretta Kelly.
{7.73->16.32}Citizens of all ages and classifications are signing up to serve in what is now being called the Second Galactic War.{16.32->25.57}According to reports, nearly 100% of able-bodied citizens have already voluntarily enlisted into the Super Earth Armed Forces.{25.57->32.56}Meanwhile, those who are unable to fight are enthusiastically doing their part, making bullets,{32.56->38.67}armor, toxic gas, and everything else needed for the Arsenal of Managed Democracy.{38.67->39.84}Coming up next,{39.84->46.10}an interview with the artist behind the smash hit ""Can't Ration My Love."" Stay tuned."
{0.00->0.44}Will do!
{0.01->2.41}Feed the flames of Justice!
{0.00->0.81}For liberty!
{0.03->1.45}The enemy held for now, {2.03->3.95}but they shall crack eventually.
{0.04->2.75}It's past time we turned that murder factory into a junkyard.
{0.00->0.70}First one.
{0.00->1.56}The Mekbuda system
{0.00->0.95}Think I saw something!
{0.00->0.42}Got 'em!
{0.02->0.76}Look out!
{0.03->0.88}There they are!
{0.00->8.26}History matters! Today, we remind you that Super Earth always has been, and always will be.
{0.00->1.91}Was that them? That was them.
{0.00->1.93}Helldiver, reporting for duty.
{0.00->1.33}Maintain your resolve!
{0.00->1.95}Only Justice speaks binary!
{0.08->3.36}What the Illuminate are planning, none can say. {3.79->7.13}The sunless depths of their minds defy comprehension, {7.55->10.96}and plumbing them only turns our eyes from Liberty's light.
{0.03->0.98}This is crazy!
{0.00->1.43}You're doing Democracy's work.
{0.17->1.41}We're safe now!
{0.01->1.53}Sweet Liberty!
{0.00->3.24}We have to get back down there. The city needs us.
{0.07->3.38}And now, another helpful tip from General Brasch.{6.80->10.12}No Helldiver can Liberate the galaxy alone. {10.70->16.39}That's why we have Team Weapons! One Helldiver shoots. Another reloads.{16.60->21.32}Together, they create an unstoppable path of wanton Liberation! {21.49->27.09}And don't worry, one stratagem comes with both weapon and reload pack.{27.40->29.85}That's a 2-in-1 combo, soldier. {30.16->34.42}BRASCH TACTICS! Use 'em, or die trying!
{0.00->3.13}Hellbomb secured. Give the 'divers space to work.
{0.18->1.74}Socialist scum.
{0.00->1.37}The Crucible system
{0.04->1.60}What are those things?
{0.00->0.64}Pack's out.
{0.00->5.85}Each Ministry is a fundamental pillar upon which Managed Democracy rests.
{0.00->2.95}This bio sample will directly increase our Freedom.
{0.00->0.72}Enemy spotted.
{0.00->3.89}If this is the price of Freedom, it's worth every penny.

{0.00->1.63}The Fornskogur system
{0.00->3.11}After their cowardly attack on New Hope City,{3.50->7.71}the Terminids think us too terror-stricken to follow them into the Gloom.{8.26->15.31}But we will show them that there is no space we cannot free; no backwater we cannot convert into{15.31->17.36}flourishing communities.

{0.00->4.26}I still remember filling out my very first Democratic Preferences Ballot—what a rush.
{0.00->0.76}Of course.
{0.00->0.54}Help! Help!
{0.00->2.04}Mission at 30 minutes remaining.
{0.03->0.63}Super Earth's{0.99->1.66}Finest!
{0.02->0.74}Be ready!
{0.02->1.35}FIRE IN THE HOLE!
{0.00->3.18}We will fight on in the memory of those we lost.
{0.00->1.32}Freedom five!

{0.00->0.44}Look, a{0.87->1.58}good bug.
{0.00->0.66}Follow me.
{0.00->2.12}Now! Attack now!
{0.00->1.51}The War rages on. {2.34->4.40}Choose where you will give your aid.
{0.00->1.88}The greatest hero I've ever seen.
{0.01->0.47}Thank you!
"{11.70->14.31}Freedom's Greetings, I'm Coretta Kelly.
{14.31->21.11}In a shocking development, a massive Automaton fleet has invaded Cyberstan and the surrounding systems.{21.11->28.82}Early reports indicate that this armada may be over 10 times larger than all previously encountered Automaton forces.{28.82->38.30}Currently, there is no information about the source of these new Automatons, or their connection to the Automaton forces encountered previously.{38.30->41.18}The unprovoked assault lasted merely hours,{41.18->46.41}quickly overwhelming the relatively undefended planets on the Galactic Fringe.{46.41->55.76}The President has already issued a response, saying ""This attack occurred as we were nearing a permanent end to conflict with the Automatons.{55.76->61.57}Now, it is clear that there can be no peace until every Automaton is utterly destroyed.""{61.58->68.57}The Helldivers have begun a counteroffensive operation with the ultimate objective of re-taking Cyberstan,{68.57->71.51}the apparent base of Automaton operations.{71.51->74.39} That's Liberty's Latest; I'm Coretta Kelly."
{0.00->0.15}How much longer?
{0.03->1.29}What are those things?
{0.00->2.51}You inspire the soldiers, Helldiver.
{0.00->1.11}Helldivers!{1.53->3.26}They'll never believe this back home!
{0.61->1.25}Shoot them! Shoot them!
{0.00->0.80}Enemy patrol.
{0.00->0.56}We're stuck!
{0.00->0.95}Last reload.
{0.00->1.33}I need a team reload.
{0.00->1.03}This isn't over.
{0.00->0.86}Even the commercials.
{0.22->1.70}Sweet sons and daughters of Freedom…
{0.04->1.97}Flag-forsaken robots!
{0.00->4.75}Maybe print a trillion pamphlets, or build a billion interplanetary radio stations, something to {4.75->6.64}break through whatever propaganda they're feedin' em.
{0.03->1.12}Bug tunnel breach!
{0.03->1.66}The Adhafera system
{0.02->1.52}The Arkturus system
{0.03->4.08}They'll never take my... moral fortitude...
{0.00->3.11}Another sweeping victory for Super Earth.
{0.00->0.79}Over here!
{0.00->1.31}RUN!
{0.00->3.12}I don't know if those Automatons were ever technically alive, {3.49->5.24}but they're definitely dead now.
{0.05->1.35}What are they?
{0.00->0.87}There's something here.
{0.00->3.62}Coordinates received. This is Pelican 1 returning to extraction radius.
{0.00->0.65}Fifth one.
{0.02->0.95}More Terminids!
{0.00->4.89}The Democratic direction of the DSS is an inspiration to behold. {5.67->8.58}It is enough to bring a tear to the eye.
{0.00->5.30}The Illuminate will stop at nothing to destroy us. They cannot be allowed to survive.
{0.00->3.77}This is Pelican 1. Helldivers are outside the extraction zone, landing aborted. 
{0.00->1.37}Objective defended.
{0.01->3.63}Don't breathe!
{0.15->1.33}The Rasp system
{0.02->2.60}Thank Super Earth for the Helldivers!
{0.00->3.07}Expunge these Xenophobes from our galaxy.
{0.10->4.66}The bots have deployed a strike force known as the Jet Brigade. {5.12->12.29}These rocketeering rabble evidently qualify as "elite" amongst the ever-inferior Automatons.
{0.02->1.45}It was nice while it lasted.
{0.06->0.59}Roger. {0.95->3.58}Pelican 1 will reattempt pickup at extraction zone.
{0.21->2.12}For the glory of Super Earth!
{0.01->2.55}Super Earth will avenge you, friend.
{0.01->3.42}I'm okay, I'm okay.
{0.01->1.99}Reloading...in a minute!
{0.06->2.18}Kill it! Destroy it!
{0.01->1.13}We made it!
{0.00->3.36}Of course, many Hive Worlds yet remain.{3.78->7.91}The cleansing of the Gloom will be an arduous and violent labor.{8.53->11.83}As are all that serve the cause of Freedom.
{0.00->1.60}Democracy needs me.
{0.05->10.84}Yeah, so much for "swarm intelligent" bugs. Not so smart after all. We're way smarter...way smarter.
{0.00->1.65}Biological sample secured.
{0.00->0.91}Objective equipment.
{0.02->2.20}Just like in the movies...
{0.00->3.95}Our resolve in the face of Tyranny will be their undoing!
{0.03->1.46}More Terminids!
{0.03->3.68}If I were a Helldiver, I think my favorite enemy to kill would be the Bots.
{0.01->1.35}It's the Illuminate!
{0.05->0.83}Fewer bots. {1.25->2.02}More Freedom.
{0.01->0.86}Stay low!
{0.12->0.80}100 meters.
{0.03->1.09}Take cover!
{0.00->2.39}We're doomed! DOOMED!
{0.06->4.52}This is Pelican 1, requesting all Helldivers to enter the extraction radius.

{0.00->1.45}Calling down a sentry.
{0.00->3.27}Alert: Defense of currently orbited planet from {3.69->7.60}Illuminate invasion has ended in temporary defeat. {8.24->11.20}Planet now under Illuminate control.

{0.00->3.00}That was the coolest moment of my entire life.
{0.00->1.28}Firing orbital strike.
{0.01->1.48}I'm hit. Patching up!
{0.02->0.61}Will do!
{0.00->0.53}That one.
{0.09->2.00}What in Liberty's name!?
{0.19->1.44}We're gonna die!
{0.01->0.93}Out of ammo!
{0.00->0.93}Whatever it takes.
{0.00->2.68}Then we'd take our juvenile firearms and blast 'em to pieces. {3.24->4.57}Simpler times.
{0.01->3.61}We'll finish what you started, Helldiver.
{0.03->1.31}Not today!
{4.24->5.88}Freedom's Greetings, I'm your host, {6.66->7.60}Coretta Kelly.{8.09->13.62}With Termicide Dispersion Towers now installed across the Barrier Planets, the Helldivers have {13.62->17.65}begun operations to fully activate the Terminid Control System.{18.76->22.22}The Termicide is reportedly proving extremely effective, {22.58->27.95}with experts saying the benefits to the local ecology far outweigh the loss of some native {27.95->28.75}species.{29.36->30.15}After the break: a {30.69->35.93}child with terminal radiation poisoning gets a surprise visit from their greatest hero. {36.37->37.04}Stay tuned.
{0.03->1.11}Take cover!
{0.00->2.51}No retreat! No surrender!
{0.03->0.56}Nice.
{0.00->0.42}Help!
{0.00->3.82}You are the tinder, and Liberty is the match!
{0.01->3.34}Our Democracy may be tested, but it will never be tainted.
{0.00->0.44}5!
{0.00->0.90}I commend you.
{0.00->3.29}Eyes up front. Helldivers're gonna show us how it's done.
{0.00->1.89}Swapping Internal Cooling Element.
{0.05->4.93}We will never forget those who fell in the defense of Malevelon Creek.
{0.04->6.33}We must take back our territory, that Freedom may unfurl its alabaster wings.

{0.00->0.30}No.
{0.03->1.61}The squids are back!

{0.00->0.68}I'll take it.
{0.00->1.21}Flag acquired.
{0.00->1.46}Not today, freaks!
{0.00->0.49}First one.
{0.00->6.96}Remember: it's not that Super Earth hates aliens. It's that aliens hate Freedom.
{0.12->2.26}I've never seen truer courage.
{0.01->1.05}Swapping battery.
{0.00->2.64}Mess with eagles, you get talons!
{0.12->5.91}Status: Liberation from Illuminate underway. Helldiver support requested.

{0.00->2.65}Of course. Liberty guide my hand.
{0.00->3.78}Soldiers make tough calls, and that sometimes means friendly fire.
{0.00->0.47}That one.
{0.14->0.57}Oh, {1.03->5.72}I see you've secured some research samples. You can spend those at the terminal over there to {5.74->7.20}upgrade the Super Destroyer. {7.77->8.52}Get enough of them, {8.88->11.22}and we'll see what this baby can really do.
{0.03->1.40}This will all be over soon.
{0.00->1.25}Good work holding the line.
{0.02->1.22}Sweet Liberty, {1.87->2.38}my leg!
{0.00->1.75}Sub-objective near your location.
{0.00->3.95}If those squids're so smart, how come they haven't figured out how to die?
{0.00->1.53}That's a message I can get behind.
{0.00->1.78}Another diver for the cause.
{0.04->3.55}Super Uranium. Safe enough for babies.
{0.13->1.64}They died a hero.

{1.70->2.12}I did my{2.77->3.12}part...
{0.00->0.62}We made it!
{0.02->1.47}It's going to cut me open!
{0.00->1.54}Super Uranium acquired.
{0.01->2.10}The Helldivers will make them pay.
{0.00->0.31}No.
{0.00->0.54}Don't need it.

{0.00->2.93}Recruit expired. Reset course and send in next candidate.
{0.00->4.58}Helldiver! Every day, you put yourself at risk to defend freedom and liberty, and I just wanna say... {5.35->5.80}Thank you.
{0.01->1.87}Maybe this way!
{0.02->1.15}Throwing supply beacon.
{0.20->2.41}Sweet Mother of Liberty. Super Earth...{3.22->3.79}fallen...
{0.00->1.87}Mission preparation aborted.
{0.04->2.52}What in the name of Freedom...?!
{0.10->1.57}That's about all I've got right now.
{0.03->1.27}This is where the shuttle lands?
{0.00->1.23}I hope it hurt.
{0.20->1.89}They're getting closer to Super Earth.
{0.02->1.20}Fire in the hole.
{0.00->1.33}Democracy conquers all.
{0.00->0.84}Using E-{1.25->1.91}711,{2.31->8.86}our scientists have successfully synthesized Dark Fluid, for the first time in human history.{9.39->11.83}This is a magnificent breakthrough.{12.27->17.84}No longer will the power of Dark Fluid be withheld from us by the miserly Illuminate.
{0.00->1.87}Maintain your resolve!
{0.00->1.28}You saved us!
{0.00->0.95}Out of stims.
{0.00->2.36}Helldiver KIA. Deploying replacement.
{0.05->6.58}The bots will stop at nothing to turn our galaxy into little more than steel and code. {7.06->10.63}Unless we stop them first. Unless we send in...{10.99->12.16}the Helldivers.
{0.00->2.36}This Tyranny will not stand!
{0.00->2.34}Blast 'em back where they came from! Woo!
{0.00->0.64}What about here?
{0.00->1.36}Welcome aboard, Helldiver, {1.85->4.27}and congratulations on completing your training.
{0.00->3.89}Sometimes I read too much and get overly motivated and kinda jittery and need to put it down.
{0.00->1.71}I am a soldier of Democracy.
{0.00->2.32}Only Democracy tells US what to do!
{0.00->0.47}3!
{0.00->3.64}I sure love that these Hellpods're deadlier than pretty much every actual weapon.
{0.00->1.34}Local fauna.
{0.00->0.91}Flag acquired.
{0.00->0.64}Fifth one.
{0.00->3.90}Our city returns to Freedom's warm embrace.
{0.00->2.42}We'll finish what you started, Helldiver.
{0.00->1.88}Let's settle the score!
{0.00->2.50}We destroyed the Illuminate once.{2.53->5.17}Now, we will do it again.
{0.00->2.52}Moradesh was lost to the Dark Fluid. {2.95->4.72}Our enemies will pay.
{0.02->1.02}When's the shuttle coming?
{0.01->1.04}We're saved.
{0.00->0.56}Fifth one.
{0.22->1.58}It's gonna cut me open!
{0.01->0.93}My friend!
{0.02->1.19}This is a nightmare!
{0.00->1.49}Human assets relocated.
{0.43->1.09}"Sure," Danny said. "{2.96->3.25}They aren't really my friends anymore, anyway." 
{0.15->3.66}I've never seen such flawless terminal activation. {4.38->8.27}Now, somewhere around here is the flag of Super Earth. {8.73->13.16}Find it, and plant it where all can see its Democratic glory. 
{0.00->0.34}Down.
{0.00->3.13}I sure am famished from all that Liberating I've been doing. {3.57->10.94}And when Helldivers get hungry, Helldivers eat Prosperitos. Prosperitos: a little taste of Freedom {11.03->12.18}in every bite.
{0.00->1.19}Orbital inbound!
{0.01->2.96}Duty... called...
{0.00->0.59}Of course.{1.34->3.14}Liberty guide my hand.
{0.00->1.48}This will complicate things.
{0.02->1.71}The Aesir Pass system
{0.00->2.82}Super Uranium. Safe enough for babies.
{0.01->1.21}Fire in the hole.
{0.02->1.22}Sending in an Eagle.
{0.00->1.73}The Widow's Harbor system
"{9.83->13.31}Freedom's Greetings, I'm your host, Coretta Kelly. 
{13.31->17.59}Today, spontaneous military parades broke out across the galaxy,{17.59->21.53}celebrating the destruction of the Meridian Supercolony.{21.53->33.64}Thanks to the courageous efforts of the Helldivers, the planet Meridia was successfully collapsed into a black hole, destroying the Supercolony and its mutated strain of Terminids.{33.64->46.61}Concerns of unforeseeable impacts from the use of Dark Fluid have proved largely unfounded, experts say, with only minor spacetime distortions observed in the area surrounding the singularity.{46.61->51.63}Terminid spread has been vastly reduced following the planet's destruction,{51.63->56.98}and efforts are now underway to develop a new and improved Termicide formula.{56.98->63.60}Looking ahead, the Helldivers are also preparing to mount a counterattack against the Automatons. 
{63.60->66.47}That's Liberty's Latest; I'm Coretta Kelly."
{0.04->2.82}Gotta fix this Liberty-forsaken arm.
{0.03->6.92}Alert: Liberation of currently orbited planet from Automaton menace has ended in {7.28->8.52}temporary defeat. {9.07->12.49}Planet remains under Automaton control.
{1.58->3.21}Managed Democracy: {4.94->7.36}The freedom to make the right choice.
{0.01->0.91}Reloading.
{0.00->0.62}Engaging.
{0.02->3.75}Super Destroyer crew assignments are some of the most sought-after in the fleet. {4.28->6.76}Everyone wants to be on a Helldiver's destroyer.
{0.00->0.75}Enemy elite.
{0.00->0.76}Southwest.
{0.00->2.25}S'gotta be somewhere safe!
{0.08->3.93}Let our enemies choke upon their territorial ambitions.
{0.00->1.96}Taste Justice, robot scum!
{0.00->1.52}Now, it's used to preserve Freedom.
{0.01->1.93}Bugs! Run!
{0.33->1.32}The Oroth system
{0.03->5.10}It was a little uncomfortable, but every citizen has to learn about the threats to Democracy at some point.{5.10->6.23}Just part of growing up.
{0.00->1.34}The Charon system
{0.00->1.28}They're coming soon, right?
{0.00->1.43}Extraction Shuttle inbound.
{0.33->1.40}No way....
{0.03->1.23}It's going to cut me open!
{0.01->1.14}Frag out!
{0.01->2.04}This can't be happening!
{0.04->1.78}Sweet Liberty, we're saved!
{0.04->1.49}The Acrux system
{0.00->1.91}Sweet Liberty, it's the bots!
{0.03->3.30}Now we're part of Super Earth's victory.
{0.00->0.31}Take cover!
{0.06->1.47}Socialist scum.
{0.00->0.57}You know, {1.13->4.03}this Destroyer has enough ordnance to level a small moon. {4.73->6.51}I've done the calculations myself.
{0.01->2.73}Helldiver -- no! Noo!
{1.06->2.47}Democracy above...
{0.00->1.17}Makes me wanna go Vote right now!
{0.04->1.92}Kill them! Kill them!
{0.00->1.28}The Haka system
{0.02->0.70}They're back!
{0.01->1.16}They'll regret this.
{0.01->2.05}Shake it off, Helldiver!
{0.00->1.49}Item collected.
{0.00->0.54}Engaging.
{0.00->0.87}ETA T-{1.29->2.86}2 minutes and 30 seconds.
{0.00->3.24}Super Earth protect us!
{0.00->1.20}Calling down a vehicle.
{0.00->1.54}I fight for Freedom.
{0.00->2.49}Managed Democracy calls for aid. {3.01->5.31}Only you can answer, Helldiver.
{0.01->0.94}Heads down!
{0.00->2.23}You have maintained our way of life.
{0.02->1.40}Hostiles, inbound!
{1.90->5.24}I've... seen worse...
{0.07->3.77}Gloom levels have dropped for the first time since it appeared.{3.77->7.29}This might be easier than we thought. But we can't get cocky.
{0.00->0.47}Vehicle.
{7.50->11.92}Freedom's Greetings, I'm Coretta Kelly, with breaking news.{12.15->19.30}A scientific breakthrough has been made using the strange liquid found on Terminid Hive worlds.{19.49->26.09}This biological substance appears to be a more concentrated form of Element 710.{26.09->29.84}Scientists have named it "Element 711."{30.46->32.68}In a watershed moment for science,{32.68->42.96}Element 711 has been successfully converted into Dark Fluid - the first-ever synthetic production of the powerful exotic matter.{43.38->48.10}The Gloom is believed to contain vast reserves of E-711.{48.56->55.89}The Helldivers have been ordered to shift their focus to maximizing extraction of the valuable resource.{56.23->60.04}That's Liberty's Latest; I'm Coretta Kelly.
